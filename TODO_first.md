Looking at the codebase, you're right to point out this potentially confusing structure. Here's what's happening:

## Current Structure

```
apps/web/src/shared/types/
├── index.ts          # Barrel export
├── types.ts          # Core domain types (ApiKey, BlockData, DiagramState, etc.)
├── nodeConfig.ts     # Node configuration system
├── errorHandling.ts  # Error handling utilities
├── nodeTypes.ts      # React component prop types
├── propertyTypes.ts  # Property panel types
└── panelConfig.ts    # Panel configuration types
```

The issue is that `types.ts` is a generic name inside a `types` directory, leading to:
- Confusing import paths: `@/shared/types/types`
- Unclear purpose from the filename
- Potential naming conflicts

## Why This Happened

This is a common evolution pattern:
1. Started with a single `types.ts` file
2. As it grew, moved it into a `types/` directory
3. Added more specific type files
4. Never renamed the original `types.ts`

## Recommended Refactoring

```typescript
// Rename types.ts to be more specific:
apps/web/src/shared/types/
├── index.ts
├── domain.ts         // Core business domain types (was types.ts)
├── nodeConfig.ts     
├── errorHandling.ts  
├── components.ts     // Component prop types (was nodeTypes.ts)
├── properties.ts     // Property system types (was propertyTypes.ts)
└── panelConfig.ts    
```

This would make imports clearer:
```typescript
// Before
import { DiagramState } from '@/shared/types/types';
import { BaseNodeProps } from '@/shared/types/nodeTypes';

// After  
import { DiagramState } from '@/shared/types/domain';
import { BaseNodeProps } from '@/shared/types/components';

// Or with barrel exports
import { DiagramState, BaseNodeProps } from '@/shared/types';
```

**Potential weakness in my analysis**: The current structure might be intentional if `types.ts` is meant to be the "core" types that everything else depends on, while other files are feature-specific. However, the generic name still reduces clarity.
