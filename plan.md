Recently, I made major modifications to the backend codebase structure. I changed it to a structure with three layers and a context at the application level that acts like a headquarter. In the domains layer, I reorganized several services, but both domain services and general services coexist, so I'm not sure if this is an efficient structure. Please analyze the codebase structure and let me know if there are any areas that could be significantly improved, considering that it's a monorepo structure and also uses a folder called 'packages'.

## ✨ Extended Refactor – packages / web / cli

When we include the other two surfaces (**apps/web** & **apps/cli**) and the
generated libraries under **packages/**, additional refactorings emerge that
benefit the whole monorepo.

### 1  Consolidate shared logic in *packages*

| Problem | Impact | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
|Diagram conversion duplicated in `apps/cli/utils` and React front-end|Fixes/bugs applied twice|Create `packages/python/dipeo_diagram` exposing `converter.py`, `validators.py`, helpers; import from server & CLI|
|LLM / Notion helpers live in server `domains/`|CLI can’t reuse; breaks layering|Move concrete implementations to `packages/python/dipeo_integrations` (infra); keep only port interfaces in `dipeo_domain`|
|GraphQL strings embedded in CLI (`api_client.py`)|Diverges from schema|Extend `make codegen` – add Python target (`python-pydantic` or `datamodel-codegen`) to generate typed operations for CLI/tests|
|Application services exist only in FastAPI project|Local CLI must round-trip over HTTP|Publish `dipeo_usecases` (application layer).  CLI can use it directly for local mode; remote mode still via GraphQL|

### 2  Strengthen Dependency Injection (server **and** CLI)

1. Replace attribute look-ups on `app_context` with a DI container (e.g.
   **Dependency-Injector** or **punq**) provided in
   `packages/python/dipeo_container` so every process boots the same wiring.
2. Example usage:

   ```python
   # apps/server – GraphQL resolver
   async def executeDiagram(
       usecase: ExecuteDiagram = Depends(di_container.execute_diagram),
   ): ...

   # apps/cli – local execution path
   from dipeo_container import Container
   result = Container().execute_diagram.run(diagram)
   ```

### 3  Clarify naming & folder structure (proposed)

```
packages/python/
  dipeo_domain/        # entities + ports (pure)
  dipeo_diagram/       # converters + validators (shared)
  dipeo_integrations/  # OpenAI, Notion, HTTP, S3 … (infra)
  dipeo_usecases/      # orchestration / application services
  dipeo_container/     # DI wiring (providers, config)

apps/
  server/              # FastAPI + GraphQL; depends on dipeo_usecases
  cli/                 # CLI; local mode -> dipeo_usecases, remote -> GraphQL
  web/                 # React / Apollo – unchanged, gets typed ops from codegen
```

### 4  Quick wins (day-one tasks)

1. **Move** `domains/llm`, `domains/integrations` → `infrastructure/external/`.
2. **Rename** `application/handlers` → `application/use_cases`.
3. Extract `DiagramConverter` into new shared package and update imports
   everywhere.
4. Add GraphQL-Codegen entry for Python operations:

   ```yaml
   generates:
     apps/cli/src/dipeo_cli/__generated__/:
       schema: apps/server/schema.graphql
       documents: apps/cli/src/**/*.graphql
       preset: python
       plugins:
         - python-pydantic
   ```

### 5  Expected pay-off

* **Single source of truth** for diagrams, converters, GraphQL operations.
* **Faster local dev** – CLI can bypass HTTP (no server boot) when desired.
* **Easier reuse** – background worker, notebook, tests share the same
  `dipeo_usecases` & DI container.
* **Lower coupling** – swapping infra adapters (S3 vs. local files) becomes a
  container config change.

## Architecture-Level Review

Below is an **“architecture-level” review** rather than a line-by-line code review.

I looked at every top-level directory and sampled files from the important ones (`apps/server/src/dipeo_server/{api,application,domains,infrastructure}`), the generated packages under `packages/python`, and the CLI. The three-layer layout (**API / Application / Domain + Infrastructure**) is sound, but a few things make it harder to reason about and to share code between the services that live in the monorepo.

---

## Key Findings

1. **Layer boundaries are fuzzy**

   * `domains/integrations` and `domains/llm` talk directly to external systems (Notion, OpenAI, etc.). That is *infrastructure*, not *domain* logic.
   * Several *domain* packages (`diagram/services/storage_service.py`, `conversation/service.py`, etc.) read from the file system or env vars via `config.BASE_DIR`. Even if they accept a `SupportsFile` protocol, the concrete implementation choice leaks into the domain.
   * Conversely, some “application” handlers (`application/handlers/*.py`) contain business rules (“append file”, “user\_response” logic) that really belong in domain services.

2. **Service naming is inconsistent**

   * You have `APIIntegrationDomainService`, `DiagramStorageService`, `FileService`, `UnifiedExecutionService`, `*NodeHandler`, etc.
     A newcomer cannot tell whether a class lives in the Domain, Application, or Infrastructure layer without opening the file.
   * “Handlers” live under `application` but behave like application-level services / use-case coordinators. Mixing the two terms adds friction.

3. **The central AppContext drifts toward a Service-Locator anti-pattern**

   * Every resolver / handler reaches into `app_context.<something>` instead of receiving the dependencies explicitly.
     This makes unit testing harder and hides coupling between layers.

4. **Monorepo / packages relationship could be cleaner**

   * Generated packages (`packages/python/dipeo_domain`) already expose the domain **models**. Yet you also keep domain **services** inside `apps/server/domains`, so they cannot be reused by the CLI or future workers without importing from `apps/server`.
   * `apps/cli` copies some helpers that conceptually belong to the same domain (diagram conversion); if the services lived in a shared package, the duplication would disappear.

---

## Recommendations

### A. Enforce Clean-/Hexagonal-Architecture Boundaries

1. **Domain layer = pure business rules**

   * Keep only entities, value objects, domain services, interfaces (e.g., `FileRepository`, `LLMPort`).
   * No `os`, `pathlib`, HTTP calls, or env access here—only protocols.
2. **Infrastructure layer = technical details**

   * Move integrations, llm, Notion, storage adapters, message bus, anything that touches the outside world to `infrastructure/{persistence,messaging,external}`.
   * Implement the interfaces declared by the domain.
3. **Application layer = use-case orchestration**

   * Rename current “handlers” to `use_cases` or `application_services`.
   * Each class represents a complete business flow and depends only on domain interfaces, never concrete infra classes.
4. **API layer = transport / serialization only**

   * GraphQL resolvers call application services and map DTOs <-> GraphQL types, nothing else.

### B. Replace the Service-Locator with Explicit DI

* Keep `AppContext` as a wiring helper, but inject dependencies into FastAPI routes / Strawberry resolvers through function parameters:

  ```python
  async def createDiagram(
      svc: DiagramUseCase = Depends(di_container.diagram_use_case),
  )
  ```
* In tests, you can then swap `DiagramUseCase` with a stub without touching global state.

### C. Promote Domain Packages to `packages/python`

* Move `apps/server/src/dipeo_server/domains/*` (except API adapters) into `packages/python/dipeo_<domain>` or merge them into `dipeo_domain`.
* Export application-layer “use-cases” in a lightweight package (`dipeo_usecases`) so the CLI, notebook experiments, or future micro-services can reuse them without importing the FastAPI app.

### D. Naming / Folder Hygiene

* Pick one suffix per layer: `*DomainService`, `*UseCase`, `*Repository`, `*Adapter`, and stay consistent.
* If you keep node-specific logic, group it under each domain instead of `application/handlers/`, or at least prefix them (`DbNodeHandler`, `WebhookNodeHandler`) and keep them thin.

### E. Leverage the Monorepo Tooling

* Define each Python package in `packages/python/*` with a `pyproject.toml` and list them in the workspace’s `make codegen` or `pnpm build` so they are built/tested in isolation.
* Apps (`apps/server`, `apps/cli`, maybe `apps/worker`) should depend on those packages instead of importing across apps.

---

## Quick Wins (Low Effort)

1. Rename `application/handlers` → `application/use_cases` and update imports.
2. Move `domains/integrations` and `domains/llm` under `infrastructure/external/`.
3. In `AppContext.startup()` instantiate interfaces, not concrete classes:
   keep the instance but expose it via its protocol (`SupportsLLM`, etc.).
4. Export `DiagramStorageService`, `ExecutionPreparationService`, etc. from a shared package and make the CLI import them instead of re-implementing helpers.

---

## Pay-off

* **Clear mental model:** every engineer knows where code belongs.
* **Better re-use:** CLI, background workers, and future micro-services all import the same domain/application packages.
* **Testing becomes trivial:** inject a fake implementation instead of monkey-patching `app_context`.
* **Long-term:** easier to carve out components (e.g., execution engine) into their own deployable service if needed.
