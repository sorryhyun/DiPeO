# DiPeO Frontend to Backend Execution Engine Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to migrate DiPeO's diagram execution engine from the current hybrid client-server model to a fully backend-based architecture. The migration will consolidate all execution logic on the server side, simplifying the architecture while maintaining performance and functionality.

## 1. Current State Analysis

### 1.1 Hybrid Architecture Overview
- **Client-Side Execution**: Start, Condition, Job, Endpoint nodes
- **Server-Side Execution**: PersonJob, PersonBatchJob, DB nodes  
- **Execution Orchestrator**: Automatically detects environment and routes execution
- **CLI Integration**: Uses Node.js bundle to leverage frontend execution logic

### 1.2 Key Components
```
Frontend (TypeScript/React)
â”œâ”€â”€ execution-orchestrator.ts    # Environment detection & routing
â”œâ”€â”€ execution-engine.ts          # Core execution logic
â”œâ”€â”€ executors/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client-safe/            # Local executors
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ server-only/            # API call wrappers
â””â”€â”€ flow/                       # Dependency resolution

Backend (Python/FastAPI)
â”œâ”€â”€ execution_service.py         # Server-only node execution
â”œâ”€â”€ node_operations.py          # Individual node endpoints
â””â”€â”€ diagram.py                  # Full diagram execution
```

### 1.3 Current Benefits
- Reduced network overhead for simple operations
- Browser-based execution capability
- Optimized performance for client-safe nodes

### 1.4 Current Challenges
- Complex codebase maintenance (TypeScript + Python)
- Duplicate logic for variable substitution, dependency resolution
- Difficult debugging across environments
- Security concerns with client-side code execution

## 2. Migration Goals

### 2.1 Primary Objectives
- **Unified Execution**: All nodes execute on the backend
- **Simplified Architecture**: Single execution engine in Python
- **Enhanced Security**: No code execution in browser
- **Improved Maintainability**: One codebase for execution logic
- **Better Debugging**: Centralized logging and monitoring

### 2.2 Expected Benefits
- Reduced frontend bundle size
- Consistent execution behavior
- Easier feature additions
- Simplified testing
- Better performance monitoring
- Enhanced security posture
