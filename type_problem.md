# Type Problem - RESOLVED

All type conversion functions have been successfully removed since the codebase now uses unified snake_case types everywhere:

✅ Removed `node_type_utils.py` file
✅ Removed `FRONTEND_TO_BACKEND_TYPE_MAP`
✅ Removed `normalize_node_type_to_backend()` function
✅ Removed `extract_node_type()` complexity
✅ Removed test file `test_node_type_consistency.py`

All node types now use snake_case format consistently:
- `start`
- `person_job`
- `person_batch_job`
- `condition`
- `db`
- `job`
- `endpoint`

No type conversion is needed anymore!
