## Active Tasks

### Phase 5: Execution Module Refactoring

Based on audit report findings, the execution module requires moderate-to-substantial refactoring to achieve consistency with the diagram module's architecture.

---

#### Sprint 2-3: High Priority Improvements

---

##### Task 30: Complete TokenManager Refactoring (HIGH-1, Part 2) âœ“ COMPLETE
**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** Medium (4-6 hours actual)
**Completed:** 2025-10-11

Continue TokenManager refactoring by extracting additional responsibilities.

**Actions:**
- [x] Extract token policy logic into `tokens/policies.py`
- [x] Create JoinPolicy enum/dataclass for "all", "any", "first" policies
- [x] Extract token counting logic into separate methods
- [x] Refactor token placement logic for better testability
- [x] Add comprehensive docstrings to all token-related classes
- [x] Review and optimize token storage data structures

**Completed Work:**
- Created `dipeo/domain/execution/tokens/policies.py` with:
  - JoinPolicyType enum (ALL, ANY, FIRST, K_OF_N)
  - JoinPolicyEvaluator class for policy evaluation
  - TokenCounter class for token counting and consumption tracking
  - TokenAvailabilityChecker protocol
- Refactored TokenManager to use TokenCounter for all token counting operations

## Testing Strategy

### Before Refactoring
```bash
make lint-server
dipeo run examples/simple_diagrams/simple_iter --light --debug --timeout=40
```

### During Refactoring
- Run tests after each file modification
- Commit after each completed task
- Test incrementally
- Check `.dipeo/logs/cli.log` for execution details

### After Refactoring
```bash
make lint-server      # Must pass
make format           # Apply formatting
pnpm typecheck        # Must pass
dipeo run examples/simple_diagrams/simple_iter --light --debug
```
