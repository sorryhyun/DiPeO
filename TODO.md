# ðŸŽ¯ DiPeO Development TODO

## Current Status: âœ… Phase 2 Enhanced Feature Organization - COMPLETED (2025-05-30)

All major refactoring work has been successfully completed! The codebase now has a clean feature-based architecture.

---

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements & Optimizations

### Phase 3: Package Integration Improvements (Low Priority)

#### 3.1 Create Package Wrapper Components
```typescript
// Example: src/features/diagram/components/Arrow.tsx
import { CustomArrow } from '@repo/diagram-ui';
import { useArrowDataUpdater } from '@/shared/hooks/useStoreSelectors';

export const Arrow = (props) => {
  const updateArrowData = useArrowDataUpdater();
  return <CustomArrow {...props} onUpdateData={updateArrowData} />;
};
```

#### 3.2 Move Package-Specific Logic to Features
- [ ] Move `@repo/diagram-ui` wrappers to `features/diagram/`
- [ ] Move `@repo/properties-ui` wrappers to `features/properties/`
- [ ] Keep core package usage in `shared/` for cross-feature functionality

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation (Low Priority)

#### 4.1 Feature-Specific Tests
```
src/features/*/tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â””â”€â”€ utils/
```

#### 4.2 Update Documentation
- [ ] Update component documentation to reflect new structure
- [ ] Create feature-specific README files
- [ ] Update import examples in documentation

### Phase 5: Advanced Optimizations (Future)

#### 5.1 Code Splitting by Feature
```typescript
// Implement lazy loading for each feature
const DiagramFeature = lazy(() => import('@/features/diagram'));
const PropertiesFeature = lazy(() => import('@/features/properties'));
```

#### 5.2 Feature Flags
```typescript
// Add feature toggle system
const FEATURES = {
  diagram: true,
  properties: true,
  conversation: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
};
```

#### 5.3 Advanced Type Organization
```typescript
// Each feature should have its own types/index.ts
src/features/*/types/index.ts
```

## ðŸ”§ Additional Enhancements (Optional)

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Add virtualization for large lists (if needed)
- [ ] Optimize bundle splitting further

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Add Storybook for component documentation
- [ ] Set up visual regression testing
- [ ] Add component performance monitoring

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add ESLint rules specific to feature organization
- [ ] Set up automated dependency analysis
- [ ] Add code complexity metrics

## ðŸ“Š Current Architecture Status:

âœ… **Completed:**
- Feature-based directory structure
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive utility functions
- Feature-specific hooks organization
- Complete import path updates
- Build & TypeScript verification
- Legacy code cleanup

ðŸŽ¯ **Architecture is ready for production use!**

---

## ðŸš¨ Next Development Focus:

With the architecture complete, development can now focus on:

1. **New Features** - Adding business functionality
2. **Bug Fixes** - Addressing any runtime issues
3. **Performance** - Optimizing for scale
4. **Testing** - Adding comprehensive test coverage
5. **Documentation** - User and developer guides

The codebase is now well-organized and maintainable for future development work.
