# Migration Status - Completed Items

✅ **COMPLETED:** All major deprecated patterns have been migrated and removed from the codebase.

## ✅ **1. Legacy Node Type Handling - COMPLETED**
- ❌ Removed `LEGACY_TO_ENUM` mapping and legacy node type support
- ❌ Removed `NodeType.from_legacy()` method 
- ❌ Updated all code to use standardized enum values (`start`, `person_job`, `condition`, `db`, `job`, `endpoint`)
- ❌ Updated test fixtures to use modern node types

## ✅ **2. Inconsistent Field Names - COMPLETED**
- ❌ Standardized all field names to single convention:
  - `personId` (not `agent`)
  - `memoryForget` (not `memory`)
  - `firstOnlyPrompt` (not `first_prompt`)
  - `defaultPrompt` (not `prompt`)
  - `modelName` (not `model`)
  - `systemPrompt` (not `system`)
  - `sourceDetails` (not `source`)
  - `targetDetails` (not `target`)
  - `key` (not `token`)
- ❌ Removed dual-support fallbacks in all files

## ✅ **3. Legacy Tuple Format in LLM Service - COMPLETED**
- ❌ Removed legacy tuple format handling from `_extract_result_and_usage()`
- ❌ Code now only supports `ChatResult` objects

## ✅ **4. Mixed Service Naming - COMPLETED**
- ❌ Removed `CHATGPT` service enum and references
- ❌ Standardized all services to use `openai` instead of `chatgpt`
- ❌ Updated cost rates and provider mappings
- ❌ Updated test fixtures and mocks

## ✅ **5. DiagramMigrator Backward Compatibility - COMPLETED**
- ❌ Removed entire `DiagramMigrator` class from `converter.py`
- ❌ Removed all `DiagramMigrator.migrate()` calls from:
  - `diagram_service.py`
  - `streaming/executor.py`
  - `api/routers/diagram.py`

## ✅ **6. DB Block Legacy Handling - COMPLETED**
- ❌ Removed fallback logic for missing `subType` in DB blocks
- ❌ Now requires explicit `subType` and `targetType` specification
- ❌ Removed auto-detection based on file extensions

## 🔧 **7. API Endpoint Naming - PARTIALLY COMPLETED**
- ✅ Fixed `/apikeys` endpoints to use kebab-case (`/api-keys`)
- ⚠️ Most endpoints already follow kebab-case convention
- Note: Only minor inconsistency was in API keys endpoints, now resolved

## 🔧 **8. Arrow/Edge Format - NEEDS COMPLETION**
- ⚠️ Some test fixtures still contain redundant `sourceBlockId`/`targetBlockId` fields
- ⚠️ Code has been updated to use only `source`/`target` but test data cleanup remains

## 🎉 **Migration Summary:**

**Status: 95% Complete** 

The codebase has been successfully cleaned of almost all deprecated and legacy patterns. All backward compatibility code has been removed since this is a development project. 

**Major achievements:**
- ✅ Removed all legacy node type handling
- ✅ Standardized field naming conventions  
- ✅ Removed legacy LLM service patterns
- ✅ Cleaned up service naming inconsistencies
- ✅ Removed backward compatibility wrappers
- ✅ Standardized API endpoint naming
- ✅ Removed DB block fallback logic

**Remaining minor cleanup:**
- Test fixture data still contains some redundant arrow fields, but this doesn't affect functionality since the code ignores them.

The codebase is now clean, consistent, and ready for continued development without legacy burden.
