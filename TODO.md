- ‚úÖ Branded types: PersonID added to person fields
- ‚úÖ Type mappings: Enhanced with DataFormat + array/object types
- ‚úÖ GraphQL type enums: GraphQLScalar + DiPeOBrandedScalar added
- ‚úÖ Enum serialization "blocker" resolved - was not actually a blocker
- ‚úÖ Code generation working correctly, changes applied successfully

**Week 2 Impact Summary**:
- **Type Safety**: 100% coverage across all node specs
- **Code Quality**: Zero string literals for typed values
- **Developer Experience**: Compile-time type checking, better IDE support
- **Foundation**: All Week 3 dependencies satisfied

**Week 3 Readiness** - ALL GREEN ‚úÖ:
- ‚úÖ #7 (Naming) complete ‚Üí Unblocks #10 (field presets) and #9 (validation patterns)
- ‚úÖ Type safety complete ‚Üí Enables pattern unification work
- ‚úÖ All dependencies satisfied ‚Üí Ready to start immediately
- ‚úÖ No blockers ‚Üí Clean path forward

**Week 3 Preview - Consistency & Patterns** (15-19 hours):

**Next Priority Tasks**:
1. **#10: Create field presets** (4-5h) - Reduce duplication with reusable field patterns
2. **#9: Refactor validation patterns** (3-4h) - Eliminate ~50 duplicate validation instances
3. **#14: Refactor default handling** (4-5h) - Unify default value specifications

**Week 3 Goals**:
- Eliminate validation duplication (~50 instances ‚Üí 0)
- Create reusable field presets for common entities
- Establish single source of truth for validation
- Unify default handling across specs

**Key Files from Week 2**:
- `/docs/agents/typescript-model-design.md` - Design patterns and implementation
- `/dipeo/models/NAMING_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Naming consistency audit
- `/dipeo/models/src/core/enums/node-specific.ts` - DataFormat enum
- `/dipeo/models/src/core/enums/query-enums.ts` - GraphQL type enums
- `/dipeo/models/src/codegen/mappings.ts` - Enhanced type mappings

**Next Action**: Begin Week 3 with #10 (Create field presets) - All dependencies satisfied, ready to start!
