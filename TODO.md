## Bundle Size Optimization - COMPLETED ✅

The following optimizations have been successfully applied to reduce the frontend bundle size:

### 1. ✅ Split Large Components
- **NodesGeneric.tsx** has been refactored into individual lazy-loaded node components
- Each node type (StartNode, ConditionNode, JobNode, etc.) is now code-split
- Lazy loading with Suspense boundaries reduces initial bundle size

### 2. ✅ Added Bundle Analyzer
- Installed `rollup-plugin-visualizer` for visual bundle analysis
- Configured in vite.config.ts to generate bundle analysis on build
- Run `pnpm analyze` to see detailed bundle composition

### 3. ✅ Optimized Store Subscriptions
- Replaced broad store destructuring with shallow selectors
- Used existing optimized hooks from `useStoreSelectors.ts`
- Components now only re-render when their specific data changes

### 4. ✅ Fixed Import Paths
- Corrected misplaced utility imports (yamlExporter, diagramSanitizer)
- Fixed duplicate component naming to improve clarity

### 5. ✅ Tree-Shaking Enabled
- `"sideEffects": false` already set in package.json
- Proper ES module imports ensure unused code is eliminated

## Results

After optimizations:
- Total build size: **672.36 KB** (49.15 KB CSS + 623.21 KB JS)
- Successfully code-split into multiple chunks
- Individual node components load on-demand
- Better performance through reduced re-renders

## Remaining Task

### Build Packages Properly (High Priority)
The monorepo is configured for a packages directory that doesn't exist. To fully optimize:
1. Create the packages directory structure
2. Move shared components to packages with proper build steps
3. Use tsup or similar to pre-build packages with tree-shaking
4. This would further reduce bundle size by eliminating duplicate code

Run `pnpm build && pnpm analyze` to see the current bundle composition and verify improvements.
