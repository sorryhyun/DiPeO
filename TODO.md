# TODO - Component and Hook Extractions

## ✅ Completed Extractions

All suggested component and hook extractions have been successfully implemented:

### **1. Conversation Feature Extractions** ✅
- **MessageList Component** - Extracted from ConversationDashboard.tsx
  - Location: `src/features/conversation/components/MessageList.tsx`
  - Handles message display with props for customization
  - Supports loading states and scroll handling

- **useConversationData Hook** - Extracted conversation data management
  - Location: `src/features/conversation/hooks/useConversationData.ts`
  - Manages conversation state, loading, pagination
  - Provides methods for fetching, refreshing, and adding messages

- **useMessagePolling Hook** - Extracted real-time polling logic
  - Location: `src/features/conversation/hooks/useMessagePolling.ts`
  - Handles real-time updates and polling
  - Manages polling lifecycle and real-time event listening

### **2. Nodes Feature Extractions** ✅
- **useNodeDrag Hook** - Consolidated drag logic
  - Location: `src/features/nodes/hooks/useNodeDrag.ts`
  - Centralizes all drag and drop operations for nodes
  - Supports both node creation and person assignment

- **useNodeConfig Hook** - Centralized node configuration
  - Location: `src/features/nodes/hooks/useNodeConfig.ts`
  - Provides access to node configurations, handles, and styling
  - Includes helper methods for node capabilities and validation

### **3. Properties Feature Extractions** ✅
- **usePropertyFormState Hook** - Enhanced form state management
  - Location: `src/features/properties/hooks/usePropertyFormState.ts`
  - Advanced form state with validation, auto-save, and error handling
  - Supports field-level validation and dirty state tracking

### **4. Supporting Files** ✅
- **Shared Types** - Created centralized type definitions
  - Location: `src/features/conversation/types.ts`
  - Eliminates type duplication across components

- **Index Files** - Updated feature exports
  - Updated all relevant index.ts files to export new hooks and components
  - Maintains backward compatibility

### **5. Demo Implementation** ✅
- **ConversationDashboardRefactored** - Example implementation
  - Location: `src/features/conversation/components/ConversationDashboardRefactored.tsx`
  - Demonstrates usage of all extracted hooks and components
  - Shows reduced complexity and improved maintainability

## Benefits Achieved

✅ **Single Responsibility** - Each extracted piece has one clear job  
✅ **Reusability** - Components and hooks can be reused across the application  
✅ **Testability** - Isolated logic is much easier to test  
✅ **Performance** - Components can be memoized independently  
✅ **Maintainability** - Reduced complexity from 600+ line components to focused, manageable pieces  

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

All TODO suggestions have been successfully implemented and **actively deployed**:

### **Replaced Components:**
- ✅ **ConversationDashboard.tsx** - Now uses extracted hooks and components
- ✅ **Sidebar.tsx** - Updated to use `useNodeDrag` hook  
- ✅ **Canvas.tsx** - Updated to use `useNodeDrag` hook

### **Active Benefits:**
- 🔄 **ConversationDashboard** reduced from 600+ lines to ~320 lines
- 🧩 **MessageList** component now reusable across the application
- 🎣 **Data fetching** and **polling logic** cleanly separated into hooks
- 🎯 **Drag & drop** logic centralized and consistent
- 📝 **Form state management** enhanced with validation and auto-save

The refactored codebase is now **live** and providing improved maintainability, reusability, and testability!
