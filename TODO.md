Looking at your current codebase state compared to the refactoring plan, here's what you've completed and what's next:

## âœ… What's Already Done:

1. **Feature structure created** - All feature directories exist with proper subdirectories
2. **Most files moved** - Core components, hooks, and utils are in their feature folders
3. **Shared resources organized** - The `shared/` directory structure is in place
4. **Package wrappers created** - Feature-specific wrappers are implemented

## ðŸ”„ What to Do Next:

You're currently at **Phase 3, Step 3** - "Update Imports Gradually". Here's what needs to be done:

### 1. **Update Import Paths** (High Priority)
Many files still use old import paths. You need to update:

```typescript
// OLD imports to fix:
import { useStoreSelectors } from '@/hooks/useStoreSelectors';
import { downloadUtils } from '@/utils/downloadUtils';
import { DiagramContext } from '@/contexts/DiagramContext';

// NEW imports:
import { useStoreSelectors } from '@/shared/hooks/useStoreSelectors';
import { downloadUtils } from '@/shared/utils/downloadUtils';
import { DiagramContext } from '@/shared/contexts/DiagramContext';
```

### 2. **Remove Old Directories** (Clean Up)
These directories still exist but should be removed:
- `src/components/`
- `src/hooks/`
- `src/utils/`
- `src/contexts/`

Before removing, ensure all files are properly moved and no imports reference them.

### 3. **Move Stores** (Optional but Recommended)
Currently stores are in `src/stores/`, but the plan suggests `src/shared/stores/`:
```bash
mv src/stores src/shared/stores
# Update all imports from @/stores to @/shared/stores
```

### 4. **Extract Missing Components** (Lower Priority)
Some suggested extractions haven't been done yet:
- Extract `MessageList.tsx` from `ConversationDashboard.tsx`
- Create `useConversationData.ts` hook
- Create `useMessagePolling.ts` hook
- Create `useNodeDrag.ts` and `useNodeConfig.ts` hooks

### 5. **Update tsconfig.json Paths**
Once imports are updated, clean up the path aliases:
```json
{
  "paths": {
    "@/features/*": ["src/features/*"],
    "@/shared/*": ["src/shared/*"],
    // Remove these old aliases:
    // "@/components/*": ["src/components/*"],
    // "@/hooks/*": ["src/hooks/*"],
    // "@/utils/*": ["src/utils/*"],
    // "@/stores/*": ["src/stores/*"]
  }
}
```

## ðŸ“‹ Immediate Action Items:

1. **Run a search-and-replace** for common import patterns:
   - `@/hooks/` â†’ `@/shared/hooks/`
   - `@/utils/` â†’ `@/shared/utils/`
   - `@/contexts/` â†’ `@/shared/contexts/`
   - `@/components/` â†’ Check each case (could be feature-specific)

2. **Create a script** to find remaining old imports:
   ```bash
   grep -r "@/hooks/\|@/utils/\|@/contexts/\|@/components/" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
   ```

3. **Test after each major update** to ensure nothing breaks

4. **Once all imports are updated**, remove the old empty directories

This refactoring is almost complete! The main remaining work is updating import paths and cleaning up the old structure. The heavy lifting of reorganizing files is already done.
