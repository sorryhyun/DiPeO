Looking at your codebase, you're right to question whether `packages` is really needed. Here's my analysis:

## Current Package Usage

The packages provide:
- **@repo/core-model**: Types, interfaces, node configs
- **@repo/ui-kit**: Basic UI components (Button, Input, Modal)
- **@repo/diagram-ui**: React Flow components (BaseNode, CustomArrow)
- **@repo/properties-ui**: Property panel components

## The Reality Check

1. **Heavy Wrapping Pattern**: Almost every package component needs a wrapper in `apps/web`:
   ```typescript
   // apps/web wraps diagram-ui components
   export const BaseNode = React.memo((props) => {
     const { isRunning } = useNodeExecutionState(id);
     const { updateNodeData, updateNodeInternals, nodeConfigs } = useDiagramContext();
     
     return <BaseNodeComponent {...props} isRunning={isRunning} ... />
   });
   ```

2. **Violated Separation**: The "zero coupling" principle mentioned in the README is broken - components need store integration, context providers, and app-specific logic.

3. **Single App Reality**: This appears to be a monolithic frontend app, not a multi-app monorepo where shared packages would make sense.

## Why It's Overcomplicated

- **False Reusability**: The components aren't truly reusable without the app context
- **Dependency Hell**: Complex workspace dependencies for no real benefit
- **Build Complexity**: Extra configuration and potential version conflicts
- **Developer Friction**: Constantly jumping between packages and wrappers

## Recommendation: Merge Into apps/web

You should consolidate everything into `apps/web`:

```
apps/web/src/
├── shared/
│   ├── types/          # from @repo/core-model
│   ├── components/     # from @repo/ui-kit
│   └── constants/
├── features/
│   ├── diagram/
│   │   └── components/ # from @repo/diagram-ui
│   └── properties/
│       └── components/ # from @repo/properties-ui
```

The only exception might be keeping types in a separate package if you genuinely plan to:
- Build a separate backend dashboard
- Create a CLI tool
- Share types with a backend

But even then, a simple `shared-types` package would suffice.

**The packages structure adds complexity without providing real architectural benefits for a single-app project.**
