# Archived Old Code Generation System Files

This directory contains files from DiPeO's old TypeScript-based code generation system that was replaced by the diagram-based "dog-fooding" approach.

## Archived Files

### Manual Registration Helper
- `register_generated_node.py` - Semi-automated script for manually registering new nodes in the old system

### Backup Files
- `generated_nodes.py.bak` - Backup of the old static node generation output
  - Header shows it was generated by: `dipeo/models/scripts/generate-static-nodes.ts`
- `HookNode.ts.bak` - Backup of old generated TypeScript node file

## Old System Overview

The old system used TypeScript scripts to generate:
- Python node classes
- GraphQL schemas
- Type conversions
- Field configurations

This required manual registration steps for new nodes, including:
1. Adding to NODE_TYPE_MAP
2. Updating GraphQL union types
3. Registering in frontend node registry
4. Creating handler files manually

## New System

The new diagram-based system:
- Uses DiPeO diagrams to orchestrate code generation
- Sources from TypeScript specifications in `/dipeo/models/src/`
- Generates all code automatically via Jinja2 templates
- No manual registration required
