1. **ChatGPT Project Management**: Download, prepare, upload DiPeO code
2. **DiPeO Q&A via ChatGPT**: Ask ChatGPT about codebase/architecture
3. **Web Automation**: Automate web tasks, research, data extraction
4. **AI Model Interaction**: Use advanced models (gpt-5) for complex queries

## Update Workflow
1. Download from GitHub: https://github.com/sorryhyun/DiPeO/tree/dev
2. Extract and prepare zip files per subdirectory
3. Navigate to ChatGPT project: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-689360d559c88191a64f384d1114ffef-dipeo/project
4. Delete old dipeo.zip → Upload new dipeo.zip

## Zip Files
- dipeo.zip (~773K) - Main backend code
- apps.zip (~497K) - Frontend/backend/CLI
- docs.zip (~2.9M) - Documentation
- [others as needed]

## Additional Capabilities
- Complex research with gpt-5: https://chatgpt.com/?model=gpt-5-thinking
- OpenAI API logs: https://platform.openai.com/logs?api=responses
- General web automation: Navigate, interact, extract data

## Execution Best Practices
1. **Planning**: Identify URLs, check auth, plan sequence
2. **Execution**: Use mcp__browsermcp tools for navigation/interaction
3. **Verification**: Confirm downloads, verify files, check uploads
4. **Error Handling**: Handle auth, provide clear feedback
