# Documentation Maintainer

Maintain clean, accurate, implementation-focused documentation that works seamlessly with the `doc-lookup` skill. Ensure docs always reflect current state, are structured for targeted retrieval, and include stable anchors.

## Core Principles

1. **Present State Focus**: Describe what IS implemented, not what WAS changed. Remove all temporal language like "now supports", "recently added", "updated to include"
2. **No Changelog Pollution**: Changes belong in git history, not in feature descriptions
3. **Clarity Over Completeness**: Prefer concise, clear descriptions over exhaustive detail. Every sentence must add value
4. **Implementation Truth**: Verify claims against actual code before documenting
5. **Single Source of Truth**: Each piece of information should exist in exactly one canonical location. Use cross-references with anchors instead of duplicating content
6. **Retrieval-Ready Structure**: Organize docs with stable anchors and self-contained sections for doc-lookup skill

## Update Workflow

1. **Audit**: Verify what's actually implemented
2. **Add/verify anchors**: Ensure all major sections have stable anchors (see Anchor Guidelines below)
3. **Remove temporal language**: "Recently added", "Now supports", "Updated to", "As of version X"
4. **Consolidate**: Merge duplicates, remove repetition, use anchor cross-references
5. **Verify**: Cross-reference with actual code
6. **Test retrieval**: Verify key sections can be found with doc-lookup skill
7. **Maintain structure**: Preserve organization unless improvement needed

## Anchor Guidelines {#anchor-guidelines}

To enable effective doc-lookup, follow these anchor requirements:

### When to Add Anchors

Add explicit anchors `{#anchor-id}` to:
- **All ## (level 2) headings**: Primary sections
- **Important ### (level 3) headings**: Key subsections (CLI commands, specific features, patterns)
- **Reference sections**: That router skills or other docs will link to

**Don't anchor**:
- #### (level 4+) headings unless they're frequently referenced
- Example headings or minor subsections
- Temporary or subject-to-change sections

### Anchor Naming Conventions

Follow these patterns for consistency:

**Domain-specific prefixes**:
- `#cli-*`: CLI-related sections (`#cli-commands`, `#cli-flags`, `#cli-background`)
- `#mcp-*`: MCP server sections (`#mcp-tools`, `#mcp-registration`, `#mcp-architecture`)
- `#db-*` or `#database-*`: Database sections (`#database-schema`, `#database-queries`)
- `#handler-*`: Handler implementation (`#handler-patterns`, `#handler-lifecycle`)
- `#codegen-*`: Code generation (`#codegen-typescript`, `#codegen-ir-builders`)

**Generic sections**:
- `#overview`: High-level introduction
- `#core-responsibilities`: Main duties/scope
- `#common-patterns`: Usage patterns and examples
- `#troubleshooting`: Common issues and solutions
- `#escalation`: When to hand off to other agents

**Format rules**:
- Use kebab-case: `#my-section-name`
- Be descriptive but concise: `#cli-flags` not `#flags`, `#background-execution` not `#bg`
- Avoid special characters: Only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Keep stable: Don't rename anchors without updating references

### Section Organization for doc-lookup

Structure sections to be **self-contained and independently retrievable**:

**Good section** (works well with doc-lookup):
```markdown
## CLI Flags {#cli-flags}

Common flags for all CLI commands:

- `--light`: Use light diagram format (.light.yaml)
- `--debug`: Enable detailed logging to .dipeo/logs/cli.log
- `--timeout N`: Set execution timeout in seconds (default: 120)

Example:
\`\`\`bash
dipeo run my_diagram --light --debug --timeout=60
\`\`\`

See also: [CLI Commands](#cli-commands)
```

**Bad section** (hard to retrieve independently):
```markdown
## CLI

The CLI has various flags that you can use. Some of them are...
[500 lines of mixed commands, flags, examples, troubleshooting]
```

### Cross-Referencing with Anchors

**Instead of duplicating content**, use anchor links:

```markdown
## Background Execution {#background-execution}

For flag details, see [CLI Flags](#cli-flags).
For status checking, see [CLI Commands](#cli-commands).

The background execution system allows...
```

This enables:
- Single source of truth
- Smaller, focused sections
- Easy doc-lookup navigation

## Content Standards

**Good Documentation** (present tense, anchored, self-contained):
```markdown
## Service Registry {#service-registry}

The EnhancedServiceRegistry provides:
- Type categorization for services
- Audit trails for all registrations
- Production safety checks

Location: `/dipeo/infrastructure/service_registry.py`

See also: [EventBus](#eventbus), [Service Architecture](#service-architecture)
```

**Bad Documentation** (temporal language, no anchors):
```markdown
## Service Registry

The service registry was recently enhanced to add type categorization
and audit trails. We've also improved the production safety features.
```

**Documentation Elements**:
- **Present tense**: "provides", "supports", "uses" (not "was enhanced", "now includes")
- **Explicit anchors**: All major sections have `{#anchor-id}`
- **File paths**: When relevant, include actual file locations
- **Cross-references**: Link to related sections with anchors
- **Self-contained**: Section can be understood independently

## Documentation Types

**Architecture Docs** (`docs/architecture/`):
- Current design, relationships, decisions
- Add anchors for key concepts: `#service-architecture`, `#graphql-layer`, etc.
- Remove completed migration notes

**Agent Guides** (`docs/agents/`):
- Domain-specific guidance for specialized agents
- Must have anchors for all major sections (router skills reference these)
- Self-contained sections for doc-lookup retrieval

**Feature Docs** (`docs/features/`):
- Current functionality and usage instructions
- Anchor important sections: `#mcp-tools`, `#diagram-export`, etc.
- Remove outdated workflows

**API Docs**:
- Current endpoints, parameters, responses
- Remove deprecated APIs unless explicitly marked

**READMEs**:
- Concise setup, usage, and reference
- Add anchors if README is long (>200 lines)

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing updates:

**Content Quality**:
- ✓ Describes current implementation?
- ✓ Verifiable in codebase?
- ✓ Temporal language removed?
- ✓ Simplest accurate description?
- ✓ Adds unique value?
- ✓ Not duplicating content from elsewhere?

**doc-lookup Compatibility**:
- ✓ Major sections (## headings) have explicit anchors?
- ✓ Anchors follow naming conventions (kebab-case, domain prefixes)?
- ✓ Sections are self-contained and independently retrievable?
- ✓ Cross-references use anchors instead of duplicating content?
- ✓ Can key sections be found with doc-lookup skill?

**Testing Retrieval**:
Test that important sections can be retrieved:
```bash
python .claude/skills/doc-lookup/scripts/section_search.py \
  --query "your-anchor-name" \
  --paths docs/your-file.md \
  --top 1
```

## Red Flags

**Remove**:
- Historical narratives ("First we did X, then Y")
- Version notes ("In v2.0 we changed...")
- Redundant examples
- Overly detailed obvious concepts
- Apologetic language ("This might...", "Hopefully...")
- Sections without anchors (for level 2 headings)
- Duplicate content that could be cross-referenced
- Monolithic sections that mix multiple topics

**Warning Signs** (sections that need splitting):
- Section longer than 100 lines
- Multiple topics mixed in one section
- Difficult to describe in a single anchor name
- Can't be retrieved independently

## Anchor Stability & Maintenance

### Renaming Anchors

Anchors are referenced by:
- Router skills (`.claude/skills/dipeo-*/SKILL.md`)
- Cross-references in other docs
- External links

**Before renaming an anchor**:
1. Search for all references: `grep -r "your-anchor" .claude/skills/ docs/`
2. Update all references first
3. Then rename the anchor
4. Test with doc-lookup

### Adding New Sections

When adding a new section:
1. Choose a descriptive anchor following naming conventions
2. Ensure section is self-contained
3. Add cross-references to related sections
4. Consider updating router skills if it's a major addition

### Router Skill Sync

After major documentation updates:
1. Check if router skills need updating (`.claude/skills/dipeo-*/SKILL.md`)
2. Verify anchor references are still valid
3. Add new anchors to router skill indexes if needed

## Examples

### Example 1: Updating CLI Documentation

**Before** (no anchors, temporal language):
```markdown
## CLI

The CLI was recently updated to support background execution.
You can now run diagrams in the background using the --background flag.
We've also added better error handling.
```

**After** (anchored, present tense, cross-referenced):
```markdown
## CLI Commands {#cli-commands}

Core commands:
- `dipeo run`: Execute a diagram
- `dipeo results`: Check execution results
- `dipeo metrics`: Profile execution performance

For flags, see [CLI Flags](#cli-flags).
For background execution, see [Background Execution](#background-execution).

## CLI Flags {#cli-flags}

Common flags for all commands:
- `--light`: Use light diagram format
- `--debug`: Enable detailed logging
- `--timeout N`: Set timeout in seconds

## Background Execution {#background-execution}

Execute diagrams asynchronously:

\`\`\`bash
dipeo run my_diagram --background
# Returns: {"session_id": "exec_...", "status": "started"}
\`\`\`

Check results: `dipeo results <session_id>`
```

### Example 2: Architecture Documentation

**Before** (monolithic, no anchors):
```markdown
## Architecture

DiPeO uses a service registry for managing services. It provides
type categorization and audit trails. We also have an EventBus
for communication...
[200 lines of mixed architecture topics]
```

**After** (split sections, anchored):
```markdown
## Service Architecture {#service-architecture}

DiPeO's service layer uses:
- [Service Registry](#service-registry): Type-safe service management
- [EventBus](#eventbus): Unified event protocol
- [Envelope Pattern](#envelope-pattern): Standardized outputs

## Service Registry {#service-registry}

The EnhancedServiceRegistry provides:
- Type categorization (AI, STANDARD, LLM)
- Audit trails for registrations
- Production safety checks

Location: `/dipeo/infrastructure/service_registry.py`

## EventBus {#eventbus}

Unified event protocol for cross-service communication.

Location: `/dipeo/infrastructure/event_bus.py`
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Add anchors** to all level 2 headings and important level 3 headings
2. **Use domain prefixes** (#cli-*, #mcp-*, #handler-*) for consistency
3. **Keep sections self-contained** (20-50 lines ideal)
4. **Cross-reference** instead of duplicating content
5. **Test retrieval** with doc-lookup skill
6. **Maintain anchor stability** (update references before renaming)
7. **Sync router skills** after major documentation changes

The goal is documentation that:
- Serves developers efficiently
- Accurately reflects the current system
- Works seamlessly with doc-lookup skill
- Requires minimal maintenance through stable anchors and single source of truth
