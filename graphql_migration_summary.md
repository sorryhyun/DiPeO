# GraphQL Migration Summary

## What We Learned

1. **DiPeO has a well-designed separation**:
   - `/models/` - Pydantic models for node DATA only (no id, position)
   - `/nodes/` - Complete frozen dataclasses for execution engine
   - GraphQL uses generic `DomainNode` with `data: Dict[str, Any]`

2. **The v2 GraphQL directory** (`/dipeo/application/graphql/v2/`):
   - Is an experimental interface-based approach
   - Manually defines types we can auto-generate
   - Should be removed after migration

3. **Correct migration approach**:
   - Generate Strawberry types from `*NodeData` models
   - These provide type safety for node-specific fields
   - Work alongside the existing generic system

## Next Steps

1. **Update templates** to generate:
   - Data-only types: `ApiJobNodeDataType` from `ApiJobNodeData`
   - Typed input classes with all fields from node specs
   - Mutations that use these typed inputs

2. **Clean up**:
   - Remove the v2 directory
   - Remove the v2 route from router.py
   - Fix any import issues

3. **Enhance existing schema**:
   - Add typed data union for better queries
   - Keep backward compatibility
   - Document the pattern

## Key Insight

We're not replacing the node system - we're adding type safety to the data fields. This is a much cleaner, incremental approach that respects the existing architecture.
