# Phase 2 Implementation Summary: Separated State Management

## Overview
Successfully implemented Phase 2 of the DiPeO architecture refactoring, which introduces separated state management to eliminate global lock contention and enable true parallel execution.

## Components Implemented

### 1. AsyncStateManager (`dipeo/infrastructure/state/async_state_manager.py`)
- Implements the `EventConsumer` protocol to process execution events asynchronously
- Buffers state updates for batch writes every 100ms
- Eliminates real-time state persistence bottleneck
- Handles all execution lifecycle events (EXECUTION_STARTED, NODE_STARTED, NODE_COMPLETED, NODE_FAILED, EXECUTION_COMPLETED)

### 2. ExecutionStateCache (`dipeo/infrastructure/state/execution_state_cache.py`)
- Per-execution cache with local locks instead of global lock
- TTL-based cache eviction (default 1 hour)
- Automatic cleanup of expired caches
- Tracks dirty state for efficient persistence
- Each execution gets its own `ExecutionCache` instance

### 3. Event Bus Integration
- Added `EVENT_BUS` service key to the registry
- Updated `app_context.py` to create and configure the event bus
- AsyncStateManager subscribes to relevant execution events
- Modified `execute_diagram.py` to use event bus when available (backward compatible)
- Updated server startup to use async container initialization

## Key Benefits

1. **Eliminated Global Lock**: Each execution has its own cache with local locks
2. **Asynchronous State Updates**: State persistence happens in background without blocking execution
3. **Batch Writes**: Multiple state updates are batched for efficiency
4. **Event-Driven**: Clean separation between execution and state management
5. **Backward Compatible**: Falls back to observer pattern when event bus not available

## Migration Path

The implementation maintains backward compatibility:
- Existing StateRegistry remains in place
- Event bus is optional - engine falls back to observers if not present
- Server startup updated to handle async initialization
- No breaking changes to existing APIs

## Next Steps

With Phase 2 complete, the system is ready for:
- Phase 3: Monitoring Without Impact (streaming monitor service)
- Phase 4: Self-Modifying Foundation (metrics collection and optimization)
- Performance testing to validate parallel execution improvements
- Gradual migration away from StateRegistry to pure event-based system
