This is a solid, scalable approach for polymorphic components.\n  - Ref forwarding: Button forwards refs to the underlying element (button, a, or a custom component), preserving correct DOM refs.\n  - Accessibility: Non-button As get role=\"button\" and aria-disabled when disabled/loading; Enter/Space trigger onClick for non-button elements; a visually accessible Spinner with aria-label.\n  - Visual consistency: Centralized styling tokens (variantClasses, sizeClasses, baseClasses) and a single fullWidthClass, which helps with maintainability.\n  - Loading state: Spinner shows only when loading, and icons hide during loading to avoid crowding.\n- Potential issues\n  - Test scaffold references a CustomComp in tests (import from __test-utils__/CustomComp) that isn\u2019t defined in the snippet. If the tester doesn\u2019t provide that utility, tests will fail to compile/run.\n  - TypeScript safety: Some props handling uses any (ref typing is wrapped as React.Ref<any>). While common in polymorphic components, this reduces strict type-safety. It\u2019s a minor risk for large codebases.\n  - ariaLabel pattern: The prop is ariaLabel (camelCase) and is mapped to aria-label on the DOM element. This is acceptable but could confuse teams that expect ARIA attributes to be expressed as aria-label in props. The approach is consistent within the code, but requires docs/training to avoid misuse.\n  - Spinner naming: Spinner is exported from Button.spinner.tsx, and the Button imports it as Spinner. This is fine, but naming consistency across files is important for larger repos.\n  - Tests rely on a specific testing setup (Vitest/Jest) and on a test utils file that isn\u2019t provided in the snippet. This could hinder standalone test execution if the test scaffolding isn\u2019t included.\n\n2) Best Practices\n- Strengths\n  - Clear separation of concerns: Button.types.ts, Button.styles.ts, Button.spinner.tsx, Button.tsx, and test scaffold follow a clean modular structure.\n  - Typing discipline: Generics for As and Omit in props help prevent prop collisions and improve reuse with non-standard elements.\n  - Accessibility emphasis: Non-button behavior is explicitly addressed (keyboard activation, ARIA attributes, focusability).\n  - DRY approach: Centralized variant/size mappings reduce duplication and make updates easier.\n- Opportunities for improvement\n  - Avoid excessive use of any: Replace React.Ref<any> with more precise union types where feasible (e.g., HTMLButtonElement | HTMLAnchorElement | Element).\n  - Prop naming consistency: Consider adopting a naming convention for ARIA attributes (e.g., ariaLabel prop) and document it if you choose to keep ARIA attributes mapped in code. Otherwise, you may prefer accepting aria-label in props directly and mapping internally (which requires aliasing in TS).\n  - Potentially remove the extra cx wrapper: If you already use clsx, you could consider inlining small composition logic or exporting a typed helper that\u2019s more clearly named (e.g., clsx or cx) and well-documented. The wrapper adds an extra indirection but isn\u2019t inherently bad.\n  - Test coverage breadth: Include tests for disabled + loading combined states, and test both native button and custom element paths without relying on external test utils.\n\n3) Code Quality\n- Strengths\n  - Strongly typed structure with a single source of truth for variants and sizes.\n  - Good readability and maintainability: meaningful names, concise logic, and clear separation of concerns.\n  - Reusable styling tokens and a minimal, predictable class composition pipeline (baseClasses, variantClasses, sizeClasses, fullWidthClass, cx).\n- Areas to enhance\n  - TypeScript precision: Replace general any with narrower types where possible; ensure the ref type is as precise as possible for each As variant.\n  - Documentation in-code: Given the polymorphic complexity, inline comments or a short doc block explaining the typing approach, how As maps to props, and the accessibility decisions would help long-term maintainability.\n  - Testing reliability: Ensure test scaffold is self-contained (i.e., include CustomComp or adjust tests to avoid external dependencies) so the generated code can run in isolation.\n\n4) Production Readiness\n- Strengths\n  - Accessible and keyboard-friendly by design.\n  - Polymorphism is well-typed and extensible to multiple underlying elements.\n  - Tailwind-based styling is centralized and scalable for production themes.\n  - Small, focused Spinner component for loading state improves UX.\n- Minor risks\n  - External dependencies: The code relies on clsx; ensure it\u2019s listed as a dependency or provide a lightweight internal equivalent. The prompt could require either bundling an internal cx utility or explicitly listing dependencies.\n  - Test scaffolding completeness: The test snippets assume certain test utilities and structures (e.g., CustomComp). For production usage, ensure tests are self-contained or provide all necessary utilities.\n  - Type-safety caveats: As noted, some use of any in ref typing reduces strictness. If your codebase emphasizes strict TS guarantees, tighten these types in prompt expectations.\n\nPrompt Effectiveness\n\n- How well did the prompt guide code generation?\n  - Excellent on scope: The prompt asked for a production-ready polymorphic Button in React + TypeScript with Tailwind, accessibility, and a small test scaffold, plus a project structure and usage docs. The generated code aligns closely with that brief.\n  - Covers many important aspects: polymorphic typing, ref forwarding, a11y considerations, a11y-friendly loading spinner, tests scaffold, story/docs option, and a cohesive file layout.\n  - Includes a usable, end-to-end example with typing, styling tokens, and test scaffolding, which is strong for PRs and onboarding.\n\nPrompt Gaps\n\n- What\u2019s missing or underspecified\n  - Dependency handling: The prompt didn\u2019t require avoiding or opting into external libs like clsx. The generated code uses clsx but doesn\u2019t ensure the project config includes it. If you want truly self-contained code, the prompt should specify to implement a tiny internal classNames utility or to ensure a dependency is declared.\n  - Strict TypeScript safety: The code uses some any in the forwardRef path. The prompt could request fully type-safe refs (e.g., generics that map to the exact underlying element types) to avoid any.\n  - Test completeness and self-containment: The tests reference a CustomComp and a __test-utils__ folder that aren\u2019t provided in the snippet. The prompt should require building out or inlining minimal test utilities or ensure tests are entirely self-contained.\n  - Consistent ARIA naming: The prompt uses ariaLabel prop naming for accessibility. While acceptable, a stricter prompt might require either a direct aria-label prop (and re-export a thin adapter) or clear documentation about the ariaLabel approach to avoid inconsistency across teams.\n  - Documentation granularity: The prompt includes a README.md but could require richer API docs, contract examples, and explicit accessibility guarantees (e.g., when to provide aria-label vs when button text is sufficient).\n  - Explicit edge-case coverage: Prompt could request tests for edge cases like disabled + loading, href behavior for non-button As, and focus/keyboard interaction in non-standard As.\n\nImprovement Suggestions Needed\n\n- Make dependencies explicit or self-contained\n  - If you want a self-contained code sample, require an internal lightweight clsx-like utility or request that clsx be installed and documented in package.json. If you allow dependencies, require the generator to include a minimal package.json snippet showing these devDependencies (e.g., tailwindcss, react, typescript, vitest or jest, @testing-library/react, clsx).\n- Enforce stronger TypeScript safety\n  - Prompt should request eliminating any where feasible, and targeting precise element-type unions for refs (e.g., ref types mapped to HTMLButtonElement | HTMLAnchorElement | etc.). Ask for explicit tests that verify ref typing for each As variant.\n- Ensure test scaffolding is self-contained\n  - Require that the generated code includes any test utilities (CustomComp or minimal stubs) within the same code base or provide a clear instruction to implement them within the snippet.\n- Specify naming conventions\n  - Decide on ARIA prop naming: ariaLabel (internal) with mapping to aria-label, or expose aria-label directly as a prop and map accordingly. If you pick one approach, require the generator to consistently apply it and document it.\n- Expand edge-case testing\n  - Prompt for tests around disabled + loading states, correct behavior when using As='a' without href, and keyboard activation parity with native elements.\n- Improve documentation expectations\n  - Ask for a compact API reference, a quickstart example, and accessibility guarantees in the README, plus notes on how to extend variant/size tokens.\n- Clarify the recommended test framework and configuration\n  - If you have a preference (Vitest vs Jest) and a TS config alignment, specify it in the prompt so the generated scaffolding includes appropriate configs, scripts, and example test commands.\n- Encourage explicit API surface in code comments\n  - Prompt for in-code comments that explain the polymorphic typing strategy, the purpose of aria-label mapping, and rationale for non-button semantics.\n\nCritical Issues to Address\n\n- Self-contained tests: Ensure the test suite is self-contained or supply the missing test utility (CustomComp). Relying on external placeholders in the snippet can mislead users when integrating into a real repo.\n- Dependency handling: Decide whether to embed a small internal classNames utility or rely on clsx, and make that explicit in the prompt.\n- TS ref safety: Avoid or minimize any in forwardRef path; guide the generator to use precise, narrower types for ref forwarding to improve type-safety and DX.\n- ARIA naming consistency: Pick and document a clear convention for ARIA-related props (ariaLabel vs aria-label) to prevent drift across the codebase.\n- Documentation completeness: Require the generator to include a richer in-code API doc and a minimal, self-contained usage example in the README to ease adoption.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor the prompt to enforce these improvements (e.g., specify no external deps or require internal utilities, require fully type-safe refs, require self-contained tests, and demand explicit edge-case coverage)."
