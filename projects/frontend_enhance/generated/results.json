The static method signature should accept an error parameter and return a Partial<ErrorBoundaryState>, not a full ErrorBoundaryState. Also render return type uses this.props.children as React.ReactElement, which can be unsafe if children are not a single element. Consider returning React.ReactNode or wrapping in a fragment.\n- Error boundary reset: OK as a pattern, but ensure onReset is optional and that the fallback UI handles accessibility well (screen reader announcements).\n- List virtualization robustness: The virtualization uses a fixed ITEM_HEIGHT and absolute-positioned rows. This is a simple skeleton but can fail with dynamic item heights or reflow. In production, you\u2019d want to guard against varying item heights, or provide a more robust virtualization strategy (e.g., measured virtualization or a well-tested library).\n- Global suspense resource usage: createResource starts loading on module import time. This is fine for a demo, but in a real app you\u2019d want per-instance resource management or a hook-based data layer to control reloads, retries, and cancellation.\n- Unused import in App.tsx: HeavyListLoader is imported but not used; this will trigger lint/tsc noUnusedLocals in stricter configs. Either use it or remove the import.\n- SSR considerations: The code relies on DOM-related APIs (e.g., scroll handling, absolute positioning) which are client-side. This is acceptable for a client app, but ensure no server-only logic runs on SSR and that any initial render avoids browser-only APIs.\n- i18n/RTL integration: While scaffolding exists, the code doesn\u2019t wire RTL direction to components. RTL logic is present in a separate hook/file but isn\u2019t consumed by List or Theme components. If RTL awareness is important, integrate a global direction/dir propagation to spacing and alignment in components.\n- Container queries and fluid typography: The prompt requested container-query guidance and fluid typography, but the codebase mainly uses fixed heights and Tailwind utilities. If container-query responsiveness is required, add responsive wrapper strategies or CSS-in-JS with container queries and demonstrate with a sample typography scale.\n- Type exposure: ListProps<T> is re-exported, which is fine, but ensure consumers don\u2019t rely on internal types leaking implementation details. It\u2019s fine for a skeleton, but in a production library you might want a separate API surface for public types.\n- Security: The code mentions sanitization utilities but does not provide a concrete sanitization utility or sanitize data at the data layer. If you intend to demonstrate safe rendering with user-supplied content, include a sanitization utility and demonstrate its usage.\n- Test coverage depth: RTL scaffolding is present, but real tests for virtualization windowing, onLoadMore behavior, error boundary resets, and i18n/RTL checks are not included. Expand tests to cover those scenarios.\n\nPrompt Effectiveness\n\nHow well the prompt guided code generation\n- Strengths\n  - The prompt was highly prescriptive, calling for generics, render props, compound components, Suspense, code-splitting, accessibility, theming, RTL, and a design-system friendly approach. It also required a realistic data-loading pattern, error boundaries, and testing scaffolding.\n  - It demanded a production-ready skeleton with a clear module layout (src/components/List, contexts, hooks, etc.), which helped produce a modular codebase.\n  - It encouraged a sample data flow (mock API) and a suspense-based loader, which led to the HeavyList + Suspense demo.\n- Gaps within the prompt\n  - Some implementation details were left to interpretation, notably container-query guidance and fluid typography, which were not fully realized in the code.\n  - The prompt asked for thorough a11y (WCAG 2.1 AA) but didn\u2019t specify every exact aria arrangement or keyboard navigation edge-case for a long list.\n  - It asked for SSR readiness, but didn\u2019t explicitly require guards for SSR-safe event handling or avoidance of browser-only APIs in initial render.\n  - It asked for \u201csafe rendering; input sanitized in data layer\u201d but did not include a concrete sanitization utility to generate and demonstrate this pattern.\n  - It requested comprehensive testing scaffolding but stopped short of including more exhaustive RTL/integration tests, accessibility checks, and interaction tests (e.g., onLoadMore, virtualization windowing tests).\n\nPrompt Gaps\n\nImportant instructions missing or under-specified\n- ErrorBoundary correctness: Specify the exact TS signature for getDerivedStateFromError and ensure render returns a ReactNode-safe result.\n- Dynamic item heights: If the List should support dynamic item heights, require a more robust virtualization approach or a property to toggle height strategy.\n- RTL integration details: Require explicit direction propagation to layout/spacing for all subcomponents, and show an example using the i18n hook/getDirectionForLocale.\n- Container queries and fluid typography: Request a concrete example or a small component demonstrating container-query-aware typography scaling and how to wire to Tailwind tokens.\n- Sanitization utility: Require a concrete sanitizeData function and show its usage at the data layer (even as a mock) with tests.\n- Per-instance data loading controls: Move away from a module-scoped suspense resource toward a hook-based data loader with cancelation, refetch, and parameterized fetch.\n- NoUnusedLocals/NoImplicitAny: Instruct generators to avoid unused imports and to strictly type all hooks/components to pass strict TS rules.\n- Testing depth: Add explicit RTL tests for virtualization, keyboard navigation, load-more behavior, error boundaries, theming, and RTL layout checks.\n- SSR guardrails: Include a requirement that components are SSR-friendly by default, with a clear rule that no direct window/document usage occurs during render (only in effects).\n\nCritical Issues to Address\n\n- TypeScript error boundary implementation: Fix static getDerivedStateFromError signature and return type; avoid returning a full state object from that static method. Address potential type mismatch in render return type for error boundary.\n- Remove or use unused import: In App.tsx, either use HeavyListLoader or remove the unused import to satisfy strict linting/tsconfig rules.\n- RTL integration: Wire RTL direction to components (spacing/alignment) and demonstrate in a test or example to fulfill RTL friendliness claim.\n- Dynamic heights: If you want production viability, either fix virtualization to handle dynamic item heights or clearly document this as a simplified skeleton with fixed item height.\n- Security note: Provide a concrete sanitization utility and show its usage in data rendering, even if data is mocked, to illustrate safe rendering practice.\n- Testing coverage: Add more comprehensive RTL and a11y tests, virtualization correctness tests, and integration tests for onLoadMore and error scenarios.\n- Container-queries and typography: Align the code with the prompt\u2019s design-system goal by implementing a small container-query example and a fluid typography scale demonstration.\n- Documentation alignment: Ensure the public API surface is clearly documented (List, ListItem, ListProps, hooks, contexts) and visible in an index barrel with consistent exports.\n\nImprovement Suggestions to the Prompt\n\n- Enforce TS correctness upfront:\n  - Include explicit constraints about correct TypeScript patterns (e.g., proper ErrorBoundary typing, ReactNode returns, noUnsafe lifecycles).\n  - Require noUnusedLocals/noUnusedParameters by default.\n- Clarify SSR expectations:\n  - Require SSR-safe code, with explicit guidance to avoid DOM access during render and to annotate any browser-only logic.\n- Define virtualization scope:\n  - Specify whether dynamic item heights are supported and, if so, mandate a robust virtualization approach or a flag to toggle height strategy.\n- Strengthen i18n/RTL integration:\n  - Request explicit wiring of a direction context to all components and include an RTL-focused test scenario.\n- Container-query and fluid typography:\n  - Mandate a concrete example showing container-query usage or provide a small token-driven typography example to demonstrate the design-system intent.\n- Data layer and security:\n  - Require a small, explicit sanitization utility and show its usage in the data layer to satisfy the security requirement.\n- Testing depth:\n  - Ask for a richer test suite outline with concrete RTL, a11y, and virtualization tests, plus example test cases and snapshots where appropriate.\n- API surface clarity:\n  - Require a clean and well-documented index barrel with all public exports, including a short API table and usage examples.\n- Code quality nudges:\n  - Encourage small, incremental PR-friendly commits (e.g., first deliver List skeleton, then add virtualization, then add Suspense/RTLS, etc.) to keep generated code approachable and maintainable.\n\nCritical issues to fix (summary)\n- Correct and secure ErrorBoundary TS typings and rendering.\n- Remove unused import or integrate HeavyListLoader usage.\n- Ensure RTL wiring is actually exercised by components and tests.\n- Consider dynamic heights for virtualization or clearly document the current fixed-height limitation.\n- Provide a sanitization utility and demonstrate its usage.\n- Expand tests to cover virtualization behavior, error handling, and RTL/a11y scenarios.\n\nIf you want me to tailor the prompt further to address specific gaps (e.g., require a particular virtualization library, add a full React Query-based data layer, or enforce stricter SSR simplicity), I can produce an updated prompt reflecting those constraints."
