"I can do that. Please choose one of the four variants below, or specify a new domain from scratch.\n\nOptions to pick (exactly as described):\n- Option A \u2014 SaaS Admin Dashboard (React + TS, Vite, Tailwind, Zustand/Context, mock REST API)\n- Option B \u2014 Blog CMS Editor (Vue 3 + TS, Vite, Tailwind or CSS Modules)\n- Option C \u2014 Portfolio Site (React + TS, Vite, Tailwind)\n- Option D \u2014 Data Visualization Dashboard (React or Vue + TS, Vite, Chart.js/Recharts)\n\nIf you\u2019d like a completely new domain, describe:\n- Domain name / product name\n- Primary goals and users\n- Constraints (frameworks, tooling, versions)\n- Data models or endpoints you want mocked\n- Any accessibility or testing requirements\n- Color theme or branding\n\nDetails that help me tailor quickly (you can skip if you want defaults):\n- Organization name and color theme\n- Tenant/role model (e.g., admin, user, manager)\n- Data shapes for key entities (e.g., /projects, /metrics, /posts)\n- Auth flow specifics (mock credentials, 401 handling, token expiry)\n\nWould you like me to generate one of the four options now, or start from a new domain? If you\u2019re unsure, I can begin with Option A (SaaS Admin Dashboard) using sensible defaults and you can adjust from there."
