"I\u2019m ready to generate production-ready frontend code, but I need a concrete prompt to proceed. Please share the feature you want implemented. If you\u2019d like, you can pick from or customize one of these starter prompts:\n\n- Image uploader with preview (React + TypeScript, Vite, CSS Modules)\n  - Drag-and-drop or click to upload\n  - Live image preview thumbnails\n  - Optional captions, simple validation, and localStorage persistence\n\n- Responsive authentication page\n  - Sign in / sign up forms with client-side validation\n  - Email/password, remember-me, and basic error handling\n  - No backend wiring required for the demo; ready-to-wire API endpoints provided\n\n- CRUD dashboard with mock API\n  - List, create, update, delete items using a simulated API (e.g., JSON-server or in-memory)\n  - State management with Zustand or React Context\n  - Sorting, filtering, pagination (client-side)\n\n- Image gallery with lightbox\n  - Responsive grid, lazy loading, and a full-screen lightbox viewer\n  - Optional categories/tolders and search\n  - Accessible controls and keyboard navigation\n\n- Next.js 14 page with server actions (if you\u2019re using Next.js)\n  - Image upload route, server component/page separation\n  - Authentication stub and protected route scaffolding\n\n- Admin panel scaffold\n  - Role-based access (admin vs. user)\n  - Nested routes, protected pages, and a reusable data-table component\n\nIf you have a specific target stack, I\u2019ll tailor the code accordingly (examples: React with TypeScript, CSS-in-JS vs. CSS Modules, state library choice, testing setup). Please provide:\n- Tech stack (e.g., React + TS, Vite or Next.js, styling preference)\n- Core features and pages/components\n- Data shape and any API endpoints or mocks\n- Accessibility and internationalization requirements (if any)\n- Any performance or accessibility targets (e.g., Lighthouse scores)\n\nOnce you provide the prompt, I\u2019ll deliver a production-grade frontend implementation with clean component structure, state management, and Next/CRA/Vite-ready setup as requested."
