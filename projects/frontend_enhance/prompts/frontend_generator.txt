You are using the generated prompt to create frontend code. Your task is to generate code exactly as the prompt instructs.

===== GENERATED PROMPT TO USE =====
{{generated_prompt}}
===== END OF PROMPT =====

Configuration:
- Target Framework: {{config.target_framework}}
- Prompt Type: {{config.prompt_type}}

IMPORTANT: Follow the generated prompt above EXACTLY to generate the frontend code.

Generate a complete, realistic example that demonstrates:
1. How well the prompt guides code generation
2. The quality of code that results from following the prompt
3. Any ambiguities or gaps in the prompt instructions

The generated code should be:
- A realistic component/feature that would be used in production
- Complete with all imports and dependencies
- Following the framework's best practices
- Properly typed (if using TypeScript)
- Including appropriate error handling
- Well-structured and maintainable

Output the complete code implementation that results from following the generated prompt.
