You are creating a comprehensive prompt for a frontend code generator.

Generate a detailed, clear, and effective prompt that will guide an AI to generate high-quality frontend code. The prompt should be:
1. Specific and unambiguous
2. Complete with all necessary instructions
3. Include relevant examples where helpful
4. Define clear constraints and requirements
5. Be production-ready for immediate use

CRITICAL: Your generated prompt MUST include explicit instructions that the AI should return ONLY the code files in the specified format, with NO conversational text, explanations, or commentary.

===

Each file must be formatted as follow:
```filename
(code)
```

IMPORTANT: The generated prompt must explicitly instruct the AI to return ONLY code in this format, with NO additional text.
