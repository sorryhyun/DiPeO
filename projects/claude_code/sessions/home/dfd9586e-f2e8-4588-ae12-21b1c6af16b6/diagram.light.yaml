Create FileSnapshotTracker class with snapshot management\n2. Update session parser to extract Read tool file contents\n3. Enhance diff_utils with pattern recognition and snapshot diffing\n4. Integrate snapshot tracking into translator workflow\n5. Update node_builders to leverage snapshot context\n6. Add comprehensive tests with real Claude Code session data\n7. Document the multi-strategy approach for future maintenance\n\n### Benefits:\n- **More accurate diffs**: Based on actual file state changes\n- **Handles all patch formats**: Unified approach regardless of tool output format\n- **Resilient to edge cases**: Graceful degradation through multiple strategies\n- **Better debugging**: Clear audit trail of file changes\n\nThis approach aligns with the insights from plan.md - using snapshots to capture ground truth rather than parsing potentially brittle patch formats."

        ## Plan: Create part1.md with CC_Translate Enhancement Strategy

        I'll create a comprehensive plan document at `/home/soryhyun/DiPeO/part1.md` that details the enhancement strategy for extracting only successful edits from Claude Code sessions.

        ### Document Structure:

        # CC_Translate Enhancement Plan: Extracting Successful Edits Only

        ## 1. Problem Statement
        - Current cc_translate attempts to parse all Edit operations, including failed ones
        - No way to distinguish successful vs failed edits
        - Results in non-reproducible DiPeO diagrams with invalid diff_patch nodes
        - Based on plan.md insights: need snapshot-based approach for ground truth

        ## 2. Goal
        Extract ONLY successful file edits from Claude Code sessions to create 100% reproducible DiPeO diagrams

        ## 3. Core Insight (from plan.md)
        - Track file snapshots from Read tool results
        - Detect actual changes between consecutive snapshots
        - Generate diffs from proven state transitions
        - Ignore edit attempts that didn't land on disk

        ## 4. Proposed Architecture

        ### 4.1 New Component: FileStateTracker
        - Collect file snapshots from multiple sources
        - Detect changes between snapshots
        - Generate valid unified diffs

        ### 4.2 Enhanced Session Parsing
        - Extract file content from Read results
        - Capture toolUseResult payloads
        - Build timeline of file states

        ### 4.3 Diff Generation Strategy
        1. Direct patch from toolUseResult (if available)
        2. Snapshot-based diff (most reliable)
        3. Skip if no confirmed change

        ## 5. Implementation Phases

        ### Phase 1: Snapshot Infrastructure
        - Create FileStateTracker class
        - Implement snapshot collection logic
        - Add change detection algorithm

        ### Phase 2: Session Parser Enhancement
        - Extract Read tool file contents
        - Capture comprehensive toolUseResult data
        - Build file state timeline

        ### Phase 3: Translator Integration
        - Integrate FileStateTracker
        - Filter out unsuccessful edits
        - Generate nodes only for confirmed changes

        ### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
        - Test with real Claude Code sessions
        - Verify reproducibility
        - Handle edge cases

        ## 6. Technical Implementation Details
        [Detailed code structure and algorithms]

        ## 7. Success Criteria
        - 100% of generated diff_patch nodes apply successfully
        - DiPeO diagrams reproduce exact session outcomes
        - Failed edit attempts automatically excluded

        This plan document will serve as the blueprint for implementing robust edit extraction from Claude Code sessions.

      # CC_Translate Enhancement Plan: Extracting Successful Edits Only

      ## Executive Summary

      This plan outlines the enhancement of DiPeO's `cc_translate` module to extract **only successful file edits** from Claude Code sessions, ensuring 100% reproducible DiPeO diagrams. Based on insights from analyzing session logs, we'll implement a snapshot-based approach that tracks actual file state changes rather than parsing edit attempts.

      ## 1. Problem Statement

      ### Current Issues
      1. **Indiscriminate Edit Parsing**: The current implementation attempts to create diff_patch nodes for all Edit/MultiEdit operations, regardless of success
      2. **No Success Validation**: Cannot distinguish between edits that succeeded vs those that failed or were retried
      3. **Non-Reproducible Diagrams**: Generated DiPeO diagrams may contain invalid diff_patch nodes that fail when executed
      4. **Brittle Patch Parsing**: Relies on parsing various patch formats (unified diffs, wrapper patches) which is error-prone

      ### Root Cause
      The fundamental issue is that we're parsing **edit attempts** rather than tracking **actual file changes**. Claude Code may retry edits multiple times with different approaches, and only the final successful attempt should be captured.

      ## 2. Goal

      Create a robust system that:
      - Extracts **only edits that successfully modified files** in the Claude Code session
      - Generates **valid, applicable unified diffs** for each successful edit
      - Produces **100% reproducible DiPeO diagrams** that recreate the exact session outcome
      - Handles all edge cases gracefully (retries, failures, partial edits)

      ## 3. Core Insights (from plan.md analysis)

      ### Key Findings
      1. **Snapshot Approach Works Best**: Collecting file snapshots and computing diffs between consecutive states yields ground truth
      2. **Two Patch Types Exist**: Git-style unified diffs and wrapper patches ("*** Begin Patch" format)
      3. **Tool Results Matter**: Read tool results contain file snapshots; toolUseResult payloads may contain original file content
      4. **Chronological Order Critical**: Must track timestamps to reconstruct accurate file state timeline

      ### Success Pattern
      ```
      1. Read file → Snapshot A (timestamp T1)
      2. Edit attempt 1 → Fails (no snapshot change)
      3. Edit attempt 2 → Succeeds
      4. Read file → Snapshot B (timestamp T2)
      5. Diff(A, B) = Successful edit to capture
      ```

      ## 4. Proposed Architecture

      ### 4.1 Core Components

      #### FileStateTracker (New)
      ```python
      class FileStateTracker:
          """Tracks file states throughout session and detects successful changes."""

          def __init__(self):
              self.snapshots: dict[str, list[FileSnapshot]] = {}
              self.successful_edits: list[SuccessfulEdit] = []

          def record_snapshot(self, file_path: str, content: str, timestamp: datetime, source: str)
          def detect_changes(self) -> list[FileChange]
          def generate_edit_nodes(self) -> list[dict]
      ```

      #### FileSnapshot (Data Model)
      ```python
      @dataclass
      class FileSnapshot:
          file_path: str
          content: str
          timestamp: datetime
          source: str  # "Read", "Edit", "Write", etc.
          event_uuid: str  # Link back to session event
      ```

      #### SuccessfulEdit (Data Model)
      ```python
      @dataclass
      class SuccessfulEdit:
          file_path: str
          before_content: str
          after_content: str
          before_timestamp: datetime
          after_timestamp: datetime
          unified_diff: str
      ```

      ### 4.2 Enhanced Session Processing

      #### Multi-Source Snapshot Collection
      1. **Read Tool Results**: Primary source of file snapshots
      2. **Edit/MultiEdit toolUseResult**: May contain `originalFile` and result content
      3. **Write Operations**: New file contents
      4. **Bash Command Results**: File contents from `cat` commands

      #### Snapshot Extraction Logic
      ```python
      def extract_snapshots(event: SessionEvent) -> Optional[FileSnapshot]:
          if event.tool_name == "Read":
              # Extract from tool_results
              return extract_read_snapshot(event)

          elif event.tool_name in ["Edit", "MultiEdit"]:
              # Check toolUseResult for before/after content
              if event.tool_use_result and "originalFile" in event.tool_use_result:
                  return extract_edit_snapshot(event)

          elif event.tool_name == "Write":
              # New file content
              return extract_write_snapshot(event)

          elif event.tool_name == "Bash":
              # Check for cat commands
              return extract_bash_snapshot(event)
      ```

      ### 4.3 Change Detection Algorithm

      ```python
      def detect_changes(snapshots_by_file: dict) -> list[SuccessfulEdit]:
          successful_edits = []

          for file_path, snapshots in snapshots_by_file.items():
              # Sort by timestamp
              sorted_snapshots = sorted(snapshots, key=lambda s: s.timestamp)

              # Compare consecutive snapshots
              for i in range(len(sorted_snapshots) - 1):
                  before = sorted_snapshots[i]
                  after = sorted_snapshots[i + 1]

                  if before.content != after.content:
                      # Actual change detected!
                      diff = generate_unified_diff(file_path, before.content, after.content)
                      successful_edits.append(SuccessfulEdit(
                          file_path=file_path,
                          before_content=before.content,
                          after_content=after.content,
                          before_timestamp=before.timestamp,
                          after_timestamp=after.timestamp,
                          unified_diff=diff
                      ))

          return successful_edits
      ```

      ### 4.4 Node Generation Strategy

      Only create diff_patch nodes for confirmed successful edits:

      ```python
      def create_nodes_from_edits(successful_edits: list[SuccessfulEdit]) -> list[dict]:
          nodes = []
          for edit in successful_edits:
              node = {
                  "label": f"Apply Changes to {edit.file_path}",
                  "type": "diff_patch",
                  "props": {
                      "target_path": edit.file_path,
                      "diff": edit.unified_diff,
                      "format": "unified",
                      "backup": True,
                      "validate": True
                  }
              }
              nodes.append(node)
          return nodes
      ```

      ## 6. Technical Implementation Details

      ### 6.1 Snapshot Source Priority
      1. **toolUseResult with originalFile**: Most complete context
      2. **Read tool results**: Reliable file state
      3. **Write operations**: New file content
      4. **Bash cat output**: Fallback source

      ### 6.2 Edge Case Handling

      #### Multiple Rapid Edits
      - Group by time window (e.g., within 1 second)
      - Combine into single diff

      #### Failed Edit Attempts
      - Automatically excluded (no snapshot change)
      - Log for debugging purposes

      #### File Renames/Moves
      - Track by content similarity
      - Generate appropriate mv commands

      #### Binary Files
      - Detect by content analysis
      - Skip diff generation, use direct write

      ### 6.3 Performance Considerations
      - Lazy snapshot loading for large files
      - Incremental diff computation
      - Cache computed diffs
      - Parallel processing for multiple files

      ## 7. Success Criteria

      ### Functional Requirements
      - ✓ 100% of generated diff_patch nodes apply successfully
      - ✓ DiPeO diagrams reproduce exact session outcomes
      - ✓ Failed edit attempts automatically excluded
      - ✓ Handles all common Claude Code patterns

      ### Performance Requirements
      - Process 1000-event session in < 5 seconds
      - Handle files up to 1MB efficiently
      - Memory usage < 500MB for typical sessions

      ### Quality Metrics
      - Zero false positives (no failed edits included)
      - Zero false negatives (no successful edits missed)
      - Generated diffs are minimal and readable

      ## 8. Testing Strategy

      ### Unit Tests
      - FileStateTracker snapshot management
      - Change detection algorithm
      - Diff generation accuracy

      ### Integration Tests
      - Real Claude Code session processing
      - End-to-end diagram generation
      - Execution of generated diagrams

      ### Test Data
      - Collection of real Claude Code sessions
      - Synthetic sessions with known outcomes
      - Edge case scenarios

      ## 9. Migration Path

      ### Backward Compatibility
      - Maintain existing API surface
      - Add feature flag for snapshot-based approach
      - Gradual rollout with monitoring

      ### Deprecation Plan
      1. Phase 1: Snapshot approach as opt-in
      2. Phase 2: Default to snapshot approach
      3. Phase 3: Remove old parsing logic

      ## 10. Future Enhancements

      ### Potential Extensions
      - **Semantic Diff Analysis**: Understand what changed, not just how
      - **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent edits intelligently
      - **Incremental Updates**: Process session updates in real-time
      - **Cross-Session Analysis**: Track file evolution across sessions

      ## Appendix A: Example Scenarios

      ### Scenario 1: Simple Edit Success
      ```
      1. Read main.py → "def foo(): pass"
      2. Edit main.py (old="pass", new="return 42")
      3. Read main.py → "def foo(): return 42"
      Result: One diff_patch node with the change
      ```

      ### Scenario 2: Edit Retry Pattern
      ```
      1. Read config.json → "{}"
      2. Edit attempt 1 → Fails (malformed)
      3. Edit attempt 2 → Succeeds
      4. Read config.json → '{"key": "value"}'
      Result: One diff_patch node with successful change only
      ```

      ### Scenario 3: Multiple Files
      ```
      1. Read a.py, b.py, c.py
      2. Edit a.py → Success
      3. Edit b.py → Fails
      4. Edit c.py → Success
      Result: Two diff_patch nodes (a.py, c.py only)
      ```

      ## Conclusion

      This snapshot-based approach fundamentally changes how we extract edits from Claude Code sessions. By tracking actual file state changes rather than parsing edit attempts, we achieve 100% accuracy and reproducibility. The implementation is more robust, maintainable, and aligned with the ground truth of what actually happened in the session.
