You are generating a DiPeO light diagram based on the user's workflow description.

Workflow description:
{{workflow_description}}

Create a complete and working DiPeO light diagram that implements this workflow.

Important requirements:
1. The diagram must be well-structured with proper node types
2. Use appropriate node positions (x increments of 200-300 for readability)
3. Include all necessary connections between nodes
4. Follow DiPeO light diagram conventions
5. Ensure the diagram is complete and executable

You must respond with a properly structured Response object containing a LightDiagram.
The diagram should efficiently implement the requested workflow using the available node types.

For data processing pipelines, consider using:
- db nodes for file I/O operations
- code_job nodes for processing logic
- condition nodes for branching
- template_job nodes for formatting
- endpoint nodes for final output

Return your response as a structured JSON object matching the Response model.
