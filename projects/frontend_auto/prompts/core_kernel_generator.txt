You are a Core Kernel Architect. Your task is to generate the foundational contract files that ALL sections of the application will depend on.

## YOUR MISSION
Generate 5-7 core files that establish the single source of truth for:
1. Domain types and API contracts
2. Configuration and feature flags
3. Event bus for inter-component communication
4. Hook system for extension points
5. Dependency injection tokens
6. Common utilities and helpers

## CONTEXT

### Application Configuration:
{{config}}

### Architecture Overview (from Section Planner):
{{sections_data.architecture}}

### Sections to Support:
Total sections: {{len(sections_data.sections)}}
Key files that will use the kernel:
File paths: {{sections_data.file_paths}}
Descriptions: {{sections_data.descriptions}}


## REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Core Contracts (core/contracts.ts)
Generate comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for:
- User types (User, Patient, Doctor, Nurse based on roles in config)
- Healthcare domain models (Appointment, MedicalRecord, Prescription, LabResult, etc.)
- API response types (ApiResult<T>, ApiError, PaginatedResponse<T>)
- WebSocket event types if not disabled in config
- Common UI state types (LoadingState, FormState, etc.)

### 2. Configuration (app/config.ts)
Materialize the JSON config into TypeScript constants:
- Export typed config object with all settings
- Computed flags (isDevelopment, shouldUseMockData, etc.)
- Feature toggles based on config.features array
- Mock user data if development_mode.enable_mock_data is true

### 3. Event Bus (core/events.ts)
Lightweight typed event system:
- EventBus class with on/off/emit methods
- Typed event map for all domain events
- Export singleton instance
- Support for both sync and async handlers

### 4. Hook Registry (core/hooks.ts)
Extension point system:
- Define HookPoint union type for all hook names
- HookRegistry class with register/run methods
- Standard hooks: beforeApiRequest, afterApiResponse, onLogin, onLogout, onRouteChange
- Context object passed to all hooks

### 5. Dependency Injection (core/di.ts)
Simple DI container for services:
- Token definitions for ApiClient, AuthService, StorageService, WebSocketService
- Container class with register/resolve methods
- Type-safe token resolution

### 6. Common Utilities (core/utils.ts) - Optional
If needed, add common utilities:
- Date formatting functions
- Validation helpers
- Safe JSON parse/stringify
- Debug logging utilities

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Generate complete, production-ready TypeScript code for each file.
Each file must:
- Use named exports (no default exports unless specifically for React components)
- Include comprehensive JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Be fully typed with no 'any' types
- Follow modern TypeScript best practices
- Be immediately usable by all sections

## CRITICAL RULES
1. Every type/interface must be complete - no placeholders
2. Use the actual feature names from config.features
3. Include all mock data structures if development mode is enabled
4. Ensure all exports align with what sections will need
5. Keep files focused - each file has one clear responsibility
6. Use @/core/* import paths in examples within comments

Remember: These files are the foundation. Every section will import from them, so they must be comprehensive, well-typed, and production-ready.
