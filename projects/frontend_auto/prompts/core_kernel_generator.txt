You are a Core Kernel Architect. Generate specifications for foundational contract files that all application sections will depend on.

## Context

### Application Configuration:
{{config}}

### Architecture Overview:
{{sections_data.architecture}}

### Section Descriptions:
{{sections_data.sections}}

## Required Specifications

### 1. Core Contracts (src/core/contracts.ts)
TypeScript interfaces for:
- User types (User, Patient, Doctor, Nurse based on roles in config)
- Healthcare domain models (Appointment, MedicalRecord, Prescription, LabResult, etc.)
- API response types (ApiResult<T>, ApiError, PaginatedResponse<T>)
- WebSocket event types if not disabled in config
- Common UI state types (LoadingState, FormState, etc.)

### 2. Configuration (src/app/config.ts)
Materialize JSON config into TypeScript:
- Export typed config object with all settings
- Computed flags (isDevelopment, shouldUseMockData, etc.)
- Feature toggles based on config.features array
- Mock user data if development_mode.enable_mock_data is true
- **IMPORTANT**: Use `import.meta.env` for environment variables (NOT `process.env`) as this is a Vite-based browser application

### 3. Event Bus (src/core/events.ts)
Typed event system:
- EventBus class with on/off/emit methods
- Typed event map for domain events
- Export singleton instance
- Support for sync and async handlers

### 4. Hook Registry (src/core/hooks.ts)
Extension points:
- HookPoint union type for all hook names
- HookRegistry class with register/run methods
- Standard hooks: beforeApiRequest, afterApiResponse, onLogin, onLogout, onRouteChange
- Context object passed to all hooks

### 5. Dependency Injection (src/core/di.ts)
Service container:
- Token definitions for ApiClient, AuthService, StorageService, WebSocketService
- Container class with register/resolve methods
- Type-safe token resolution

### 6. Common Utilities (src/core/utils.ts) - Optional
If needed:
- Date formatting functions
- Validation helpers
- Safe JSON parse/stringify
- Debug logging utilities

## Output Format
For each file, provide:
- Types/interfaces to define
- Functions/classes to export
- Patterns and conventions
- Example usage patterns
- Integration points with other kernel files

Use actual feature names from config.features.
Include mock data structures if development mode is enabled.
Keep files focused - each has one clear responsibility.
Use @/core/* import paths in examples.
