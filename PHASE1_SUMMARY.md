# Phase 1 Implementation Summary: Event-Driven Core

## What was implemented:

### 1. Event Protocol (`dipeo/core/events/execution_events.py`)
- Defined `EventType` enum with execution lifecycle events
- Created `ExecutionEvent` dataclass for event data
- Established `EventEmitter` and `EventConsumer` protocols

### 2. Async Event Bus (`dipeo/infrastructure/events/event_bus.py`)
- Implemented `AsyncEventBus` with fire-and-forget emission
- Per-consumer queues with configurable size limits
- Non-blocking event delivery with backpressure handling
- Clean startup/shutdown lifecycle

### 3. Event-Based Execution Engine (`dipeo/application/execution/typed_engine_event_based.py`)
- Refactored `TypedExecutionEngine` to use event bus
- Replaced direct observer calls with event emissions
- Added execution metrics to events
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing interface

### 4. Tests (`dipeo/tests/infrastructure/events/test_event_bus.py`)
- Event emission and consumption
- Multiple subscriber support
- Event filtering by type
- Queue overflow handling

### 5. Example Usage (`dipeo/examples/event_based_execution_example.py`)
- Demonstrates metrics collection without blocking execution
- Real-time monitoring implementation
- Clean separation of concerns

## Benefits Achieved:

1. **Decoupled Architecture**: Execution engine no longer directly depends on observers
2. **True Parallel Execution**: Events are processed asynchronously without blocking node execution
3. **Extensibility**: New consumers can be added without modifying the engine
4. **Performance**: Fire-and-forget emission eliminates observer bottlenecks
5. **Foundation for Phase 2**: Ready for separated state management

## Next Steps (Phase 2):
- Implement Async State Manager as event consumer
- Remove global state lock
- Create per-execution state caches
- Migrate from StateRegistry to event-based state persistence
