# Frontend Enhance Guide

## Overview

The `frontend_enhance` project represents an advanced AI-driven system for generating production-ready React frontend applications through iterative prompt refinement and intelligent memory management. Using a multi-agent architecture within DiPeO, it automatically improves generation prompts until the output meets production quality standards.

**Key Innovation**: An autonomous quality feedback loop combined with an intelligent memory selector system that enables AI agents to collaborate on complex applications while maintaining precise context control across sections.

## System Architecture

```
Configuration → Section Planning → Memory Selection → Code Generation → Quality Evaluation
                      ↑                    ↓              ↓              ↓
                      └─────────── Iterative Refinement & Context Management ────┘
```

The system orchestrates specialized AI agents in an intelligent feedback loop:

1. **Section Planner** - Breaks complex applications into manageable sections
2. **Memory Selector** - Intelligently selects relevant context from prior sections
3. **Frontend Generator** - Produces React/TypeScript code with precise context
4. **Code Evaluator** - Assesses quality and provides improvement feedback

## Core Components

### 1. Configuration System (`frontend_enhance_config.json`)

Defines comprehensive requirements for modern frontend applications:

```json
{
  "app_type": "dashboard",
  "framework": "react",
  "styling_approach": "tailwind",
  "target_score": 85,
  "max_iterations": 3,
  "prompt_requirements": [
    "React 18+ features",
    "TypeScript with strict typing",
    "WCAG 2.1 AA compliance",
    "Core Web Vitals optimization",
    // ... 30+ production requirements
  ]
}
```

**Key Requirements Categories**:
- Modern React patterns (hooks, compound components, render props)
- Performance optimization (code splitting, virtualization, memoization)
- Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Security (CSP headers, XSS protection, input sanitization)
- Testing (React Testing Library, integration patterns)
- Real-time features (WebSocket, optimistic updates)
- Offline functionality (service workers, local storage)
- Internationalization (i18n/l10n, RTL support)

### 2. Consolidated Generation Pipeline (`consolidated_generator.light.yaml`)

The main workflow implementing section-based generation with intelligent memory management:

```yaml
# Multi-agent collaboration with memory management
persons:
  Section Planner:    # Plans application architecture and sections
  Frontend Generator: # Creates React code with memory context
  memorize_to: "Necessary codes to implement or which are dependent to"
  at_most: 1          # Intelligent memory limiting

# Section-based generation flow
nodes:
  - Plan Application Sections
  - Load Section Data (iterative)
  - Generate Frontend Code (with memory selection)
  - Write Section Results
  - Check Continue (until all sections complete)
  - Rename Generated Files
```

**Process Flow**:
1. Load configuration and plan application sections
2. For each section, apply memory selector to choose relevant prior context
3. Generate frontend code with precisely selected memory
4. Write section results and continue to next section
5. Compile and organize all generated files into runnable application

### 3. Memory Selector System

Intelligent context management system that enables generation of complex applications by selecting only relevant prior sections:

```python
# Memory selection modes
class MemorySelector:
    async def apply_memory_settings(
        self,
        memorize_to: str,     # Selection criteria
        at_most: int,         # Memory limit
        task_prompt_preview: str,  # Current task context
    ) -> list[Message]:
        # GOLDFISH mode: No memory
        if memorize_to == "GOLDFISH":
            return []
        
        # LLM-based intelligent selection
        selected_ids = await self.select(
            criteria=memorize_to,
            candidate_messages=candidates,
            at_most=at_most,
        )
```

**Memory Management Features**:
- **Intelligent Selection**: Uses LLM to choose relevant context from prior sections
- **Keyword-Based Filtering**: Matches technical terms and component dependencies
- **Dynamic Limits**: Adjusts memory based on section position and complexity
- **Content Deduplication**: Avoids redundant information in memory selection
- **Architectural Awareness**: Understands component relationships and dependencies

**Memory Modes**:
- **Default**: All messages involving the person (traditional behavior)
- **Selective**: LLM-based selection using natural language criteria
- **Limited**: Enforces strict memory limits with intelligent prioritization
- **GOLDFISH**: No memory retention (fresh context each section)

### 4. Code Extraction & Setup (`extract_and_setup_app.py`)

Sophisticated system to transform AI output into runnable React apps:

```python
def extract_code_blocks(content: str) -> Dict[str, str]:
    # Extract code from multiple formats:
    # - Numbered lists (1) path/to/file.ext)
    # - Comment format (// path/to/file.ext)
    # - Direct file paths

def detect_dependencies(files: Dict[str, str]):
    # Intelligently detect required packages:
    # - React Query/SWR for data fetching
    # - Tailwind for styling
    # - Testing libraries
    # - Form libraries

def create_app_files(app_path: Path, files: Dict[str, str]):
    # Generate missing scaffolding:
    # - main.tsx entry point
    # - App.tsx with component showcase
    # - Test setup files
    # - CSS with Tailwind directives
```

**Intelligent Features**:
- **Multi-format parsing**: Handles various code block formats
- **Dependency detection**: Analyzes imports to determine packages
- **Smart scaffolding**: Creates missing boilerplate files
- **Component discovery**: Finds and showcases generated components
- **Configuration generation**: Creates Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind configs

### 5. Quality Evaluation System

## Workflow Execution

### Step 1: Configure Requirements

Update `frontend_enhance_config.json`:
```json
{
  "app_type": "e-commerce",
  "features": [
    "product catalog",
    "shopping cart",
    "checkout flow"
  ],
  "target_score": 90
}
```

### Step 2: Run Consolidated Generation Pipeline

```bash
dipeo run projects/frontend_enhance/consolidated_generator --light --debug --timeout=300
```

**Memory Configuration Options**:
```yaml
# In your workflow YAML
Frontend Generator:
  memorize_to: "React components, TypeScript interfaces, utility functions"
  at_most: 3  # Limit to 3 most relevant prior sections

# Alternative memory modes
memory_modes:
  conservative: {memorize_to: "imports, types", at_most: 1}
  moderate: {memorize_to: "components, hooks, utils", at_most: 3}
  comprehensive: {memorize_to: "all implementation details", at_most: 5}
  goldfish: {memorize_to: "GOLDFISH"}  # No memory
```

### Step 3: Monitor Progress

The system processes sections sequentially, showing:
- Section planning with architectural decisions
- Memory selection choosing relevant prior context
- Code generation building on established patterns
- File organization and dependency management

### Step 4: Run Generated App

```bash
# Automatic run script created
./projects/frontend_enhance/run_smartlist_app.sh

# Or manually
cd projects/frontend_enhance/smartlist-app
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Intelligent Memory Selection

The memory selector enables complex applications by managing context intelligently:

```python
# Memory criteria examples
criterias = {
    "component-requirements": "Button, Input, Modal, Card, component, props, TypeScript",
    "state-management": "Context, useReducer, TanStack, Query, state, dispatch, hooks",
    "design-system": "Tailwind, theme, dark mode, tokens, CSS, colors",
    "performance": "memo, lazy, Suspense, virtualization, optimization"
}

# Dynamic memory limits based on section position
def calculate_memory_limit(section_index, total_sections):
    if section_index <= 2: return 3      # Early sections need less context
    elif section_index <= 5: return 5    # Middle sections need moderate context
    else: return 8                        # Later sections may need more context
```

**Benefits**:
- **Scalability**: Generate large applications without context overflow
- **Consistency**: Maintain patterns across sections through selective memory
- **Efficiency**: Process only relevant information, reducing token usage
- **Quality**: Better code generation through precise context selection

### 2. Multi-Format Code Extraction

Handles various AI output formats:
```javascript
// 1) src/components/Button.tsx
// 2. components/Card/Card.tsx
// File: src/hooks/useData.ts
```

### 3. Intelligent Dependency Resolution

Detects and installs only needed packages:
- Analyzes imports and code patterns
- Adds dev dependencies for testing
- Configures build tools appropriately

### 4. Component Showcase Generation

Automatically creates demo pages:
```tsx
// Detects List component, generates:
<List 
  items={sampleData}
  onItemClick={handleClick}
/>
```

### 5. Section-Based Progressive Enhancement

Each section builds on architectural foundation with intelligent context:
- Section 1-3: Core components with minimal dependencies
- Section 4-6: Feature components using established patterns
- Section 7+: Complex integrations with comprehensive context selection

**Memory-Aware Section Planning**:
```python
# Section dependencies drive memory selection
section = {
    "id": "dashboard-metrics",
    "dependencies": ["base-components", "data-hooks"],
    "file_to_implement": "src/features/dashboard/MetricCard.tsx",
    "memory_criteria": "Card, useQuery, TypeScript interfaces"
}
```
