# Testing Summary for Input Resolution Interfaces

## Test Coverage

### 1. Interface Implementation Tests (`test_interface_implementations.py`)
- ✅ StandardNodeOutput creation and methods
- ✅ NodeStrategyFactory and strategy selection
- ✅ PersonJob strategy first input detection
- ✅ Transformation engine with all built-in transformers
- ✅ Execution context adapter
- ✅ Runtime resolver normalization
- ✅ PersonJob edge processing logic

### 2. Adapter Edge Cases (`test_adapter_edge_cases.py`)
- ✅ Complex PersonJob first/default input scenarios
- ✅ Conversation state special handling
- ✅ Smart output extraction (improved over legacy)
- ✅ Data transformation compatibility

### 3. Existing Test Suite
- ✅ All 59 original tests still passing
- ✅ Integration tests passing
- ✅ Data transformation tests passing
- ✅ 98% coverage maintained

## Key Improvements

### Smart Output Extraction
The new system intelligently extracts outputs from various formats:
```python
# Legacy: Only looks at "value" field
{"value": "main", "outputs": {"specific": "data"}}  # Can't find "specific"

# New: Checks both value and outputs fields
{"value": "main", "outputs": {"specific": "data"}}  # Finds "specific" → "data"
```

### Enhanced Transformations
- Format strings: `"Hello {value}!"` 
- Content type conversions
- Variable extraction
- Tool result extraction

### Clean Architecture
- Clear separation between compile-time and runtime
- Strategy pattern for node-specific behavior
- Pluggable transformation engine
- Backward compatibility through adapters

## Test Results

Total: **74 tests passing**
- 11 new interface tests
- 4 adapter edge case tests
- 59 existing tests (unchanged)

The new implementation is smarter while maintaining compatibility where it matters. Since DiPeO doesn't have many existing diagrams, this is the perfect time to adopt these improvements.
