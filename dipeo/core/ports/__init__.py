"""Port interfaces for DiPeO core layer.

These interfaces define the contracts that infrastructure implementations must follow.
They enable the core and domain layers to depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

ARCHITECTURAL NOTE - Historical Context:
This directory originally contained protocol definitions that were later reorganized:
- Flow control and node execution protocols were temporarily moved to core/domain/services/ 
  but have since been removed in favor of direct concrete implementations in the application layer
- diagram_loader.py was moved to dipeo/core/application/services/
- execution_context.py was moved to dipeo/core/application/context/

The current architecture uses concrete implementations directly rather than abstract protocols,
following the principle noted in CLAUDE.md about direct implementation usage.
