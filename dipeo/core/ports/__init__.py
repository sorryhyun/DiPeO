"""Port interfaces for DiPeO core layer.

These interfaces define the contracts that infrastructure implementations must follow.
They enable the core and domain layers to depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

ARCHITECTURAL NOTE - File Relocations (2025-07-09):
Several files were moved from this directory to better align with hexagonal architecture:

Moved to dipeo/core/domain/services/:
- flow_control.py → Core domain logic for execution flow decisions
- node_execution.py → Core domain logic for node execution

Moved to dipeo/core/application/services/:
- diagram_loader.py → Application service for diagram loading (uses FileServicePort)

Moved to dipeo/core/application/context/:
- execution_context.py → Application-level context object

These were relocated because they represent internal application/domain logic,
not interfaces to external infrastructure (which is what true hexagonal ports are for).
