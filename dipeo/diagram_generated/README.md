# Diagram-Generated Code

This directory contains all code generated by the DiPeO diagram-based code generation system (`dipeo run codegen/main`).

## Important Notes

⚠️ **ALL FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY ARE AUTO-GENERATED**
- Do not edit these files manually
- Changes will be overwritten on the next generation run
- To modify generated code, update the source specifications in `files/codegen/specifications/`

## Directory Structure

```
diagram_generated/
├── models/          # TypeScript models generated from node specifications
│   ├── base.ts     # Base interfaces for generated models
│   └── nodes/      # Generated node type models
├── graphql/        # GraphQL schemas (if generated here)
├── components/     # React components (if generated here)
└── configs/        # Configuration files (if generated here)
```

## Relationship to dipeo/models

This directory is **completely separate** from `dipeo/models/`:
- `dipeo/models/` contains hand-written TypeScript models (source of truth)
- `dipeo/diagram_generated/` contains diagram-generated code
- No circular dependencies between these two systems

## Generation Process

Generated by running:
```bash
dipeo run master --light --debug --no-browser --timeout=20
```
