# File Persistence Module - Refactored Architecture

This module has been refactored to follow the Single Responsibility Principle with better separation of concerns.

## Component Overview

### BaseFileService
- **Purpose**: Core file operations (read, write, save)
- **Responsibilities**: Basic I/O, path resolution, backup creation
- **Lines**: ~230 (down from 700+)

### JsonFileService
- **Purpose**: JSON-specific operations
- **Responsibilities**: JSON parsing, writing, updating with merge strategies
- **Dependencies**: Uses BaseFileService for I/O

### PromptFileService
- **Purpose**: Prompt file management
- **Responsibilities**: List, read, save, and organize prompt files
- **Dependencies**: Uses BaseFileService for I/O

### FileOperationsService
- **Purpose**: Advanced file operations
- **Responsibilities**: Copy, move, append, delete with checksums
- **Dependencies**: Uses BaseFileService and AsyncFileAdapter

### ModularFileService
- **Purpose**: Facade combining all services
- **Responsibilities**: Provides unified interface, delegates to specialized services
- **Pattern**: Facade pattern for backward compatibility

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Modularity**: Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Testability**: Smaller, focused classes are easier to test
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to JSON operations don't affect file operations
4. **Extensibility**: New file types can be added as separate services
5. **Reusability**: Services can be used independently

## Usage Examples

```python
# Using the facade (recommended for backward compatibility)
file_service = ModularFileService(base_dir="/data")

# Basic operations
result = file_service.read("config.json")
await file_service.write("output.txt", "content")

# JSON operations
data = await file_service.read_json("config.json")
await file_service.write_json("output.json", {"key": "value"})

# Prompt operations
prompts = await file_service.list_prompt_files()
prompt_content = await file_service.read_prompt_file("example.txt")

# Advanced operations
await file_service.copy_file("source.txt", "dest.txt", verify_checksum=True)
await file_service.append_to_file("log.txt", "New entry", add_timestamp=True)

# Or use specialized services directly
json_service = JsonFileService(base_file_service)
await json_service.update_json("config.json", {"new_key": "new_value"})
```

## Migration Notes

The ModularFileService maintains backward compatibility with the original interface while internally delegating to specialized services. No changes are required in existing code.
